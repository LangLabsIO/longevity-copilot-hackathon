[Music] i think that we have been extremely successful in the last 20 years at discovering mechanisms at starting to develop efforts to translate those mechanisms but when you look at the actual magnitude of effect of interventions it's really not that impressive and this is just a list of probably the most common interventions that people think about non-genetic interventions in laboratory animals today and what's indicated here is that the largest magnitude of effect for lifespan is an intervention that was first published 80 years ago right almost 90 years ago and actually the longest lifespan extension from a non-genetic intervention that i know of is this experiment from rick weinrich and roy walford that was done in the 1980s and that's the 65 percent caloric restriction and then when you look at the pharmacological interventions that we're studying you know by and large today they're all substantially smaller so rapamycin of course is the most robust and reproducible pharmacological intervention for targeting aging that we have today it's my personal favorite we're testing rapamycin and pet dogs right now in a clinical trial but its efficacy is not as great as caloric restriction it's not even close and then when you look at the other interventions they're not as effective as rapamycin at least for lifespan um so so i feel like we need to get beyond this right there would be it's important for the field not only to find new interventions but to find particularly effective interventions [Music] you
