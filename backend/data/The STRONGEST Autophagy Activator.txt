[Music] foreign it is truly an amazing molecule I stumbled upon it by someone saying hey did you know about such and such and I didn't so I did my deep dive and was absolutely floored yeah absolutely floored because it does things that none of the other agents can do it just fills gaps that we needed to fill incredibly good for preserving cellular function which is what sperm needs because they're in physiologically very stressful conditions you know that's just the way that it is but in terms of what it does for us and I will won't go through everything but I'll go through the highlights so in the epigenetics category um it basically inhibits something called p300 then activates autophagy so it is one of the strongest activators of autophagy that we have assuming unusual because we don't actually we have things that kind of do it a little bit but not really as potently so this is huge in our arsenal of autophagy uh in the same category what's kind of cool so sperminine is a long positively charged chain and it loves to sit in the negatively charged grooves of your DNA so you have two grooves it's a spirally staircase we've all seen the Watson and Creek model on a Groove in the major Groove and the molecule spermatian loves to Cozy itself in there um in the grooves it does is it sort of makes it more Compact and it protects it from outside damage so there's studies where it protects it from thermal denaturation protects it from radiation and whereas I haven't been studies I'm completely and utterly convinced it's going to protect it from glycation and other Asians that you don't want I sort of decided that this was sort of like bubble wrapping your DNA just protects your DNA and that is something we have not seen in any other molecular agents I mean magnesium will protect the coronary structure of um some things but it doesn't protect your DNA per se the way spermity does so that is just one of the most miraculous things ever my brain has to go through this list yes it does stimulate mitochondrial Biogen this is oh oh here's a big one I'm missing it actually helps with the mitochondrial transition pores so mitochondrial transition pores or pores in the outside of the mitochondria that open more frequently with age and they leak mitochondrial contents into the cell it destroys the electrochemical gradient and you get all the sort of cytotoxic stuff going out into your cell and it's we don't know why it opens more with age it just does they normally do open and close but they just open more as as you get older um but spermatine actually helps to control that and the only other thing that does that is metformin the only drawback is that it's so pricey where was I oh yes hair it's so cool it stimulates stem cells in the hair follicles so it absolutely does help with hair so I'm convinced by the time you like you know you take your spermity and you take your Colonial Cava you're gonna have the fullest set of hair ever [Music] [Music]
