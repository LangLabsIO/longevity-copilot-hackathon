[Music] so we have an NAD boosting supplement called Neo time plus and it works in a different way from a precursor supplement because instead of just supplying the raw materials to the cell for them to make NAD it actually fixes the underlying root causes that cause NAD to decline in the first place so I'm talking all the cellular process that are using up anad such as cd38 DNA repair enzymes for example and then also the fact that there are critical enzymes in the NAD production process that have declined so nppt for example the rate limitting enzyme in the Salvage pathway that is absolutely critical for NAD production and recycling now one of the questions that I get asked a lot is can you use Nudo time plus in combination with IV infusions or NAD patches for example so I just thought I'd jump on and record a quick video to explain our views on this so first of all IV infuses and NAD patches the jewelry is still out there as to how the NAD actually gets into the cell there are some cells where naad can go directly in for example through the conexon 43 Channel there are some cells that it simply is too big to cross the membrane the jur is still out who knows how it gets in there we need some good scientific studies done on this however the benefits and the anecdotal evidence is that people do feel a benefit with infusions and patches so regardless of how that NAD is actually getting into the cell you really need to think about what is happening once it's in the cell and actually are you getting the most benefit out of those IV infusions and those patches as you could be now to explain this I am just going to share my screen and I'm going to show you actually what happens in the cell when you take an NAD infusion or NAD viral patch or even a precursor so regardless of the way that the Ned gets into the cell whether it's precursors coming in here or it's the NAD is getting straight in or it's being broken down into precursors first and then it's entering the cell you have an increase in NAD in the cell now this is good because we want more NAD in the cell but this NAD is actually used up so it's used up by the parts for DNA repair it's used up by the cin to activate all the downstream beneficial Pathways and it's also used up by by cd38 and when it's used up it's broken down into nicotinamide which can be seen here now nicotinamide can either go one of two ways it can either be then recycled via the Salvage pathway using this nppt enzyme back into useful NAD again or if it's not recycled it starts to build up and it actually needs to be excreted from the cell now if you put a precursor or you put a NAD infusion to allow more NAD into the cells what happens is you get this initial boost of NAD okay it's then all used up so you get the kind of benefits of it but they're shortlived because once this NAD is being used up it is broken down into nicotinamide and then if this is an old cell which does not have the capacity to recycle this nicotinamide back into NAD because this enzyme here has declined with age then what happens is you get this nicotinamide buildup the body somehow has to get rid of it so it is actually methylated by this enzyme here nnmt which means it is excreted from the cell is methyl nicotinamide now what this happens what this causes sorry is methyl donor depletion in older cells because you put in this huge amount of NAD in which is suddenly getting used up Suddenly resulting in a large amount of nicotinamide and this nicotinamide has to get out so you've got to methylate it to get it out of the cell so you get metal donor depletion and that is why a lot of people say that you need to actually take some methyl donors to actually replenish your methyl groups when you're taking say NR or nmn or using IV infusions so the way to get around this is before you have your IV infus Fusion or before you have your patch you actually need to make sure that your cells are ready for it so you need to make sure that actually this Salvage pathway is working so you need to increase levels of this rate limiting enzyme NT because nppt is the key enzyme here it is rate limiting which means it's the bottleneck in the process so if you have low nmt which you do as you get older then you will have low recycling so this is exactly what Neto time plus does it has ingredients in it which increase the expression of this enzyme and we have data to show that and when you increase the expression of this en enzyme what you find is that this nicotinamide is not excreted from the cell it's actually recycled back into NAD so that means you can have your IV you can have an increase in NAD in cells it can be used up in all these beneficial processes broken down into nicotinamide and then actually recycled back into NAD again so what happens is you get a prolonged NAD boost in the cells so all that money you've spent on an IV infusion actually lasts longer so we promote people to actually take Neto time plus alongside an infusion or an IV patch um to actually prolong the effects of it because what our product does is it fixes the cell's ability to recycle the NAD once you've got it into the cells so I hope that makes sense of why you would use our product Neto time Plus in combination with an IV infusion or an NAD patch because it will actually prolong the effects and prolong the benefits that you are going to get from that if you don't use something like this to actually improve the Salvage pathway before having an IV or during having an IV then you're going to get a boost but it is not going to last it would be much better if you could continue to reap the benefits of those High NAD levels long after the infusion has [Music] ended
