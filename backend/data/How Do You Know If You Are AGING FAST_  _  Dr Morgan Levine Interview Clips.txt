[Music] we're already biomarkers of Aging are really useful proxies that can be used in a number of different applications so number one which we're mostly talking about today is in clinical trial endpoints so rather than having to do a clinical trial that lasts 10 20 potentially 50 years if we actually did have good proxies for the biological aging of some uh tissue or cell type we could use these to represent what we think the mortality or morbidity effect might be um another application is just in better understanding of the basic biology of Aging um and then finally in Risk stratification so looking at populations identifying at-risk people whether that's um for recruitment into different interventions um or just better monitoring so the goal of these biomarkers of Aging um our first you know most simply just to differentiate someone who's 20 years old from someone who's eight years old um but probably more importantly is among people who are the same chronological age can we differentiate people who are accelerated agers versus those who are decelerated agers so people are aging faster than we would expect and then finally um is to actually look at modifiability so can we actually intervene in the aging process and actually assess whether um some specific intervention uh is actually um effective in slowing the aging process so next um so one thing actually measuring biological age for a clinical trial or basic research um there's actually a number of different what we might call biological levels at which you can measure biological age so I we actually think that aging probably starts at some of these lowest levels of biological organizations so at the molecule level and actually propagates up and really what we see at the organismal level is kind of the emergence of the changes that are happening at these lower levels so technically you could actually measure biological age at any of these levels and and which one you pick actually might depend on um what the question you're asking is so next so in developing biomarkers I think I kind of want to focus on four major goals uh for this talk so first validity reliability modifiability and finally mechanism focused biomarkers next so starting with validity so what does this mean is um one big issue in actually developing biomarkers of Aging is that age is a latent aging is latent concept it's actually something we can't observe and so anything we do is not going to have a ground Truth for which we can evaluate it so Steve already did a really great job at kind of discussing the first generation versus second generation epigenetic clocks so again these first generation clocks and a lot of biomarkers of Aging even beyond the ones developed in uh using DNA methylation are developed as what we call chronological age predictors so you get thousands to potentially hundreds of thousands of variables um you do either some machine learning or deep learning technique to see if you can actually predict the chronological age of a sample so um one issue with these types of clocks in actually applying them either for clinical trial use or for monitoring health and aging is that in training these they actually the algorithm may not prioritize the most critical um biomarkers for health outcomes for mortality risk and that was pretty well demonstrated actually in the epigenetic clocks where we found that the ones that are actually trained not on chronological age ended up being better predictors of the outcomes that we're most interested in um so some reasons why this might happen is that you actually might be adjusting out some of the things that create differences biological differences among people the same age so obviously if the algorithm is trying to get the best predictor of chronological age it might actually um reverse weight some of the things that differentiate people at the same age um another issue is mortality selection so if you're getting very accurate age predictions for people who are 80 90 or 100 those are probably not biomarkers that actually have an impact on mortality because people who are 90 or 100 are not some random subset of their original Birth Cohort they're actually the most resilient selective people so they actually should be predicted younger than they are and if you're getting good age predictions and then you're probably not measuring things that actually have an impact on mortality um so this is kind of where we came in with what we call these second generation measures so can we actually measure things um like or actually predict things like phenotypic aging or some proxy for biological aging and develop biomarkers for them so we think that by doing this we'll actually be capturing more important information um but there are a few drawbacks so number one it's a lot easier to get a huge uh sample for training if your outcomes age age is really easy to measure um so most of the data available for making a second generation clocks is going to be a lot smaller and then the other issue is that it's not entirely clear what our outcome actually should be and whether we should combine a number of different outcomes whether we should just use things like mortality which might um prioritize uh things important for uh cardiovascular disease and cancer or whether we should combine a bunch of different um outcomes to make better kind of phenotypic age predictors next so the second important thing um in thinking about designing these biomarkers of Aging whether for clinical trials or consumer use is reliability so basically if I take multiple samples from the same person whether it be on the same day whether it be a week later do I get the same answer I didn't to end up one level so this is something I work as a bioinformatics consultant with the leasing health and they recently put out an epigenetic uh uh biological age predictor called index um for consumers and it was really important for us to make sure that we were giving someone a reliable answer when we were measuring their epigenetic age so um unfortunately when we actually looked at the existing epidemic clocks we found that actually at the end of one level they're quite unreliable so this chart is based on nine technical replicates taken from each person we had eight uh subjects in this and this shows a number of different epigenetic clocks that have been developed this is all done in either blood or saliva and what you can see is actually you don't get that good agreement um in terms of the age that these samples are predicted at however we've developed different uh computational statistical ways around this in developing index that have actually really improved the reliability which we think is going to be very important both for Consumer markets but also in clinical trials if you're saying that your intervention is decreasing uh biological age by one or two years that should hopefully be a bigger number than your error rate so this is really important in that regard next so the other important thing is modifiability so can we actually develop biomarkers that are modifiable and um this is showing some preliminary data I'm not going to go into what this intervention is because it's unpublished but basically can you apply some intervention and see a change in however whatever biological age measure that you're measuring um and the important thing that I think is still an unanswered question in the field is you can have an intervention you might see some change in your biomarker of interest but actually does that impact Downstream morbidity and mortality risk so I think that's really where the field is and I think it'll be really critical for some of these studies like team where we actually have an intervention linked with some of these biomarkers of aging and then also following up and looking at morbidity and mortality risk in abuse populations to actually see whether um these things are all linked up and actually try and understand better um Steve mentioned um causality in terms of the biomarkers and next and finally um kind of as a last thing I think we really need to go back and focus a little bit more on kind of mechanism what are we actually capturing these biomarkers it's not entirely clear particularly with the epigenetic clocks what what actually drives the changes in um DNA methylation that are captured by them and in fact whatever your intervention is actually might you might want to choose a different biomarker also going back to those different levels of biological organization based on what you're trying to Target and the only way to do that is to actually know mechanistically what we're capturing so my lab has been doing a lot of work where we're actually um in some ways dissecting the various stuff between other clocks and what we're finding is that they're actually Composites of a lot of different mechanistic changes that you kind of add up to get your overall clock score however some clocks are capturing more one type of mechanism than the other and it's really important to know what these different biomarkers are actually proxying um and this will also help us in terms of identifying interventions that actually might impact these measures as well [Music]
