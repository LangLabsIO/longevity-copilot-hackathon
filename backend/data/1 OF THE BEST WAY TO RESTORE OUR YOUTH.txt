[Music] but so NAD is one of these breakthroughs that I just sort of mentioned so there's there's been several different areas of biology that that have been found to have to have an influence on Aging actually and actually by controlling these areas of biology you can actually impact Aging in a positive way when one of them is NAD so NAD is he has a science lesson coming up it's basically it's a natural molecule it's found in every single cell in your body and it's got some really important functions in the cell and the two main ones are firstly it's involved in energy production so inside our cells we have little things called mitochondria which are like little energy producing factories which are converting all our food into energy that the cells can use and basically they do not function without this critical NAD molecule so that's the first thing that it's really important for is generating energy from our Foods the other thing that is really important for is actually acting as a signal in molecule in cell as levels of NAD go up and down they basically switch on and off various other things in the cell and some of the most important things that they switch on and off are repair and maintenance mechanisms in the cell so e cells are constantly needing to be repaired they're constantly under attack with oxidative stress and DNA damage and things like that and NAD actually acts as a signal a switch on lots of little repair and help other mechanisms that actually fix all that damage so that's continuously going on inside you all the time you don't even know that your cells are just repairing and recycle themselves and basically NAD coordinates some of this job so NAD is important in autophagy so autophagy is is signaled by NAD as well that's part of these maintenance repair mechanisms these cellular maintenance and repair mechanisms that are going on which the levels of NAD help to coordinate and being switched on and Switched Off and the reason it it becomes a problem with aging is because at NAD levels decline quite significantly as we get older so when we're born we have really high levels but as we get you know to midlife they've dropped quite a lot so as we get into elderly ages there's really not very much NAD left at all and to put that into sort of numbers you're looking at about a 50 decrease in your NAD levels every 20 years so you know that's an awful lot to be dropping out of the cells considering how important it is so sign is sort of said well you know I forgot this molecule in your cells it's obviously really important it does all these important jobs that are linked to ahm and it declines as you get older what happens if you don't let it decline as you get older what happens if you keep your NAD levels at a youthful level and you just don't let them decline so there was a series of very high profile studies that demonstrated that actually if you could keep NAD levels high in cells or mammals you actually could stock or even reverse some of the age-related decline that is associated with lack of energy and also with lack of Maintenance and repairing the cells so those like fundamental uh things that NAD coordinates it was done in it was done in mice and in cells and normal recently there's been strategies and studies in humans to demonstrate that you can boost your NAD levels so after those results there was a huge rush to how can we translate this to you and how can we actually keep NAD levels high in human cells and can we get the benefits from it so that has been a major area of focus within the longevity field and you know it now is starting to become more mainstream where people are asking well you know I've heard about this NAD molecule what does it do like what is it but there's still a huge lack of understanding of actually what it is and why it's important and also the best ways to actually boost it anybody as you get older foreign [Music] [Applause] [Music]
