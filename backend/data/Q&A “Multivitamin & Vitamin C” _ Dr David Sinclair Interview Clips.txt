[Music] in the front hi uh good evening dr sinclair and dr schwartz um i just had a question about the effect of vitamins on longevity um to offer a quick anecdote my both my grandparents on my father's side they are in their mid 70s and they take a plethora of vitamins every day and i've heard some claims that you should only take vitamins if you have a deficiency and i just wanted to know your opinion on that well i think your grandparents are boosting the economy they're doing some good but i think mostly they're making for expensive urine he i i would agree um that so i don't take a multivitamin by the way there are some things in there like iron that i've seen have wreak havoc on the body and create senescence cells now if you have a deficiency that's different but boosting these things above what they normally should be i think is is not advisable at least that's what i decide now there's one there's one difference so linus pauling loved vitamin c and went to his grave fighting for vitamin c and i grew up in the 70s eating a big tablet of vitamin c it was supposed to cure cold or prevent colds remember but here's one thing that's interesting those tet enzymes that remove those methyls to seemingly reverse the clock they are activated by vitamin c so one of the things we're testing now in my lab is if they actually do reverse the aging clock a little bit well a lot of interesting trials with iv vitamin c going on now great [Music] you
