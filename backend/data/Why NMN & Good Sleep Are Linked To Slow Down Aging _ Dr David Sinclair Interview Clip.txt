[Music] what's important about sleep to realize is that it does a few things one is that it's regulating your body's natural Cadian rhythms and our bodies have a section in the in the brain at the bottom here called the scn and it's about 20,000 neurons that tick over every roughly 24 hours and they've got this cycle of proteins that are RS genes and they they change through that 24hour cycle now it's not just your brain that's keeping track of the clock um it's the rest of your organs your organs are also ticking over but they're regulated somewhat independently um although they do connect through chemicals and sometimes through nodes but you can actually have things out of wax so your brain might be uh all registered through the light that you see if you travel to Australia for example from us but your other organs may not register the time difference and then that's what you get with jet lag that your liver things it's the middle of the night and then your brain things it's daylight and that's why you feel greasy when you get to a new place so what you can do is you can reset your system either if you shift work you're not getting off sleep or you travel you can't actually reset those nervs down there and what what I do is I do some meditation I try to eat um only when it's a proper meal time so you know I try to do one meal then often I'm I'm not good at that but when I get to my place uh of travel I will eat a meal but prior to that let's say on the airplane I try to eat as little as possible that ability to fast and then eat really helps reset those neurons in your brain for a new time zone um and it also helps reset your if you're not sleeping well the other thing that I do is I I that's no secret I take an NAD boosting molecule called nmn and I do that in the morning especially when I travel I might take an extra dose I do that because that that little cycle that's in nerves is regulated by NAD which is something we've studied in my lab for decades now and it controls all an enzyme called c one that controls the clock now anyone who's been paying attention or has read lifespan the book knows that s one and NAD aren't just important for the clock terms of this 24-hour clock they're important for your biological clock how fast you age or and actually by taking an man we actually we think that we can uh slow down the aging process as well but this is the key the key is that your sleep wake cycle and your aging rate are intimately linked inextricably linked actually by this NAD S one cycle you don't sleep well you probably will age more quickly and as you age you sleep less so you want to make sure you don't get into that that vicious cycle um and get enough sleep and make sure your rhythms are [Music] maintained
