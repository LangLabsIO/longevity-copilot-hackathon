[Music] carnosine right is a trans glycating agent so the V vision is very complex old people Vision which is called presbyopia which is the inability to focus up close right everyone pulls out their their reading glasses in restaurants and you're probably too young for that but all of my Cadre do except me the lens gets old for several reasons one of which is it gets like culated which means AG's land on it it just gets very stiff and carnosine is a known transglycosylating agent so it can actually help reverse the stiffness which makes focusing significantly easier so carnosine eye drops are extremely popular there there are many many brands that make it um the problem is most of the brands burn a little bit so people don't like it but there are one or two that U make it so that they don't burn and and obviously I use those viom Mitten is a completely different idea viom mitten is an skq1 uh system so it's basically a mitochondrial activator and free radical scavenger incredibly potent Unfortunately they come from Russia for a while you could get them and it was super easy but that is more retinal based versus lens based so it's completely separate but still incredibly good for your vision there's always like the big ones and then there's more you can throw in there right luttinen is is important there zanthin all the zanthin are extremely good for vision so if you think about your retina and I always it's just amazing to me right um all the things we don't like about tissue is oxygen use and glycosilation right that's that'll kill you this is what gets focused in your in in your eyeball right the retina light not only is there it gets focused there so huge influx of free radicals that are just going to like sort of kabot your retina over the course of time and glucose right your retina has more mitochondria and more glucose utilization because it's an incredibly energy intensive system so we seriously need to protect it and of course the blood flow to your retina is not so are great especially to your lens there's a very little flow to your lens so these are areas that just absolutely must be protected and I kind of consider like Vision sort of like the canary and the coal mine right everyone assumes our vision is going to sort of like Drop with age and it is one of the first things because it's just going to take the biggest hit the good news of course is we have tools to sort of prevent that a
