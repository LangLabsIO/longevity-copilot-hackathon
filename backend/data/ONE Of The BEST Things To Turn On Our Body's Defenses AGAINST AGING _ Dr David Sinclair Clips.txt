[Music] i think most people would agree with me uh these days that so nmn is a molecule that we also refer to as an nad booster and this is one of the things that my father and my wife and i and our dogs take actually i brought a vial here to show you they just i take them in pill form so what is nad so nad everybody learned about it uh in high school biology and then promptly forgot about it it may have been the reason why people left science or became disinterested because it is the most boring molecule in biology it's used for about 500 chemical reactions um it's essential for life without nad we'd all be dead in about 30 seconds but you know we were forced to learn these chemical pathways it's not that interesting things got really interesting when we realized that the body was sensing the levels of nad to determine how it was doing and what the environment was like so we now know when you exercise and when you are hungry your nad levels go up and it turns out that as you get older your nad levels go down and that that's just a correlation but what we've shown from numerous animal studies wrong studies an increasing number of studies in people is that what's going on is the nad is turning on the body's defenses against aging through a group of enzymes that we worked on and have essentially spent 25 years figuring out they require nad as well so the hormesis mediators the enzymes that we think provide the health benefits of diet and exercise are are responsible for the longevity that you get when you lead a healthy lifestyle now it's interesting to pause on this because we used to think that just running would make your blood flow better and being hungry um you know you lost weight and that's why you lived longer but actually what i believe and more and more people also believe is that nad um and these other things that raise nad are working um and also resveratrol are working because they're they're actively turning on the body's defenses against aging and it's not it's not a passive effect it's not a coincidence it's really just telling your body times are going to be tough fight against this onslaught and yeah nad is one of the best things that i know to turn on these sort of defenses [Music] you
