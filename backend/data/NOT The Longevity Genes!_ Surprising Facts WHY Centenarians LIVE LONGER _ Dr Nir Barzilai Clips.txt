[Music] 750 centenarians in their families and um and and i i should say that we've learned so much about this project but um from a genetic perspective we're going to validate it a far american federation of aging research is going to launch and we have the money from from a single donor uh an effort to recruit ten thousand centenarians so we can really find all the longevity genes and and confirm them but basically we had three hypotheses with centenarians one is that they're doing everything that we should do with the environment right actually what you would recommend to people to do they exercise they ate well they ate the right things you know they had lifespa lifestyle of the blue zone kind of lifestyle and maybe that's why they get to 100 because when they were um in the community when they were growing up when they were middle age that wasn't the recommendation maybe they just happened to do it right the second hypothesis is you know what we know that there's a lot of genetic risk genetic er snips okay we call it ovarians that are associated with diseases alzheimer's cardiovascular disease and cancer maybe those guys just don't have any any of that they have like the perfect genome okay and if that's not true well maybe they have genes that slows their aging okay so let me go one by one as far as interaction with the environment sixty percent of the men thirty percent of the women were heavy smokers i have a woman 110 and more almost 95 years she was smoking okay so if you smoke for 95 years you can live long life in fact when i asked her i met her when she was 100 years old and i asked her nobody told you you know your physicians didn't tell you to to stop smoking and she said all four physicians that told me to stop smoking they died 50 of them were overweight or obese some are obese as centenarians as well um doing even moderate kind of work of exercise walking or biking or house work less than 50 of the people uh vegetarians two percent of the people and and we could actually compare our cohort to enhance one you know that's the national health survey and hence one was the cohort that they were part of and when we compare them they're kind of the same or sometimes the sometimes worse so we are pretty sure that we can say that that there's nothing in that i in in the environment i should say we have another papers because it's not only centenarians we're we're looking at the at the children of centenarians who are healthy and we had this paper where we showed that alone of centenarians had half of the cardiovascular disease of our control those are people who don't have family history of longevity but we accumulated lots of nutritional surveys not only nutritional you know we have bmis and and exercise and and social social economy status and a lot on macronutrient and nutrients and they were all the same between those two groups they were all the same the only different was children of centenarians okay and they had 50 less of of cardiovascular disease okay the second the second hypothesis they have the perfect genome so our first 44 centenarians uh which were sequenced for whole genome sequencing okay so we had only centenarians not control not anyone only centenarians but there's a website that's called cleanvar that at that time accumulated 15 000 genotypes that if you have them you're most probably to get a disease and we said let's look if they have zero then you know then they have the perfect genome not only they didn't have zero they had on average five variants that should have made them sick and they didn't they had they had to 44 centenarians 250 variants that should have made them sick and by the way those variants are impressive for example apple e4 homozygosity for apple e4 is a major risk for alzheimer's you're you're demented by 60 70 you're dead by by by when you're 80 according to the textbook and we have two centenarians who are 100 years old and not demented okay so not so if they don't do exercise and if they don't have perfect genome something else slows their aging okay and so what what is it that slows their aging and we make lots of progress there and i'll just say for this podcast that the most impressive genotypes or or or the genomic features of those centenarians that 60 of them have functional mutations in the growth hormone pathway okay in other words their growth hormones are not active and this is really interesting because it really tells you that when you start aging and there's a breakdown you have to shift the energy from growth which you need for evolution reproduction to okay let's deal with a breakdown now and in fact we've validated those finding there's there's a there's an hypothesis in aging that's called antagonistic pleotropy something that's good for you when you're young is bad for you when you're old okay cholesterol we need cholesterol for the brain for the ovaries for the testes but if we have a lot of cholesterol metabolism when we're old we're going to clog our coronaries right so it's antagonistic pleotropy igf is the same we took data from the uk biobank anyhow it's a big data where they had measures of one of the growth hormone the important growth hormone igf-1 and and we basically showed that when you're young it protects you against variety of disease and mortality and when you're old it's the opposite picture it accelerates you when you have eye igf protective when you're young kills you when you're when when you're old so there's a major genotype for that as just one example because there's a lot in this pathway that we discover in centenarians it's just not working well and we certainly think that it's related to that by the way even when you're centenarian okay when you're centenarian and we measure this igf-1 this growth hormone the the women with the lowest growth hormone when they're old when they are centenarian live twice as long as the women with the highest growth hormone level so and they have better cognitive function and you know lots of other things so this is an example of something that we realize is very important by the way dwarf animals live longer okay that i mean the small dogs live longer and and the ponies live longer and when you do in the lab where you mutate or you get dwarf animals they always live longer even even there's a dwarf lauren a special kind of dwarfism because they don't have a receptor for the growth hormone and we're not sure that they live longer but they have less cancer and less diabetes and other diseases [Music] you
