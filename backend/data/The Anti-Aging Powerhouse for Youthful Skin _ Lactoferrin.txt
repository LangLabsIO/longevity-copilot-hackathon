[Music] so I go through these phases of things that interest me and I learn all about them and I come with a collection of things I'm going to take to fix them it sort of becomes old hat push them aside and then move on to something else which is why my pile of things just kepts getting bigger and bigger and bigger um six months ago I was ABS well I love donuts everyone knows I I love donuts donuts clearly are not good for you the glucose the cholesterol you know the lipids that sort of thing so I probably am on four or five things that block the cholesterol lipid uh process and I probably take 10 15 things that block all the glucose I decided that glucose affects you or you can you can you can change the way it affects you in in seven different essential ways example you can block the way glucose gets absorbed into your GI tract you can block gluc glycon neogenesis in your liver you can block glucose processing you can block AG production you can um you can strip ages you can do a variety of really amazingly cool things so here's my one of my latest things that I just absolutely adore is the molecule lacto faren uh so lacto Farin obviously uh carry it's from milk and it carries iron I.E the name but what's really cool is the molecule looks kind of like a bow tie or barbell right it's two big Globs with a little connector piece turns out each side has this little bonding area and it's supposed to carry iron but there's a motif in there it's called the ABCD Motif um and it loves ages if you take exogenous lacto Farin it's going to suck up your ages out of your vasculature and out of your tissues and excrete them so I call that my AG sponge right so you try to block the production of Ages so just just for your listeners so AG Advanced lication and products is when a glucose or reducing sugar fructose is actually seven to 10 times worse than glucose and ribos is like a thousand times like worse it sticks under oxidizing condition of course as we get older we're all being oxidized and then you need some sort of a metal Catalyst which we all have as well uh and then it sticks to mostly proteins but also DNA and lipids and it destroys like all of your tissues and the example that I that I like to use if you think about a cloth dinner napkin you've got fibers of collagen sort of sliding around just like in your skin and AG plops itself onto the collagen it glues itself there and much like if you put a drop of super glue on a napkin if you tried to slide the fibers they break right same thing happens to the skin you get an AG or a collection of Ages in your skin you try to slide it around collagen breaks uh and your skin just becomes very fragile and and old looking so blocking ages from sitting your skin and or trying to get rid of them and it's hard to get rid of them once they're already sort of like stuck in there if you can sort of decelerate the process um then it's a win-win I take a ton of lacto faren just because it's kind of [Music] fun
