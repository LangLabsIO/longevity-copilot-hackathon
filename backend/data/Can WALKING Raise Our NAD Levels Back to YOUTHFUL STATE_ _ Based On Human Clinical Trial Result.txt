[Music] but the question is i mean there as i mentioned we and several other groups have shown in pre-clinical models that there's this association or this this decline in nad with age but how about humans and this is a study that we haven't published yet that we're currently yeah we hope to finalize soon and this is george johnson's who's in the audience here today who spearheaded that together with the team of patrick shrow and maastricht and we we took muscle biopsies from young individuals and as well from older individuals older adults and these older adults were subsetted according to their activity profile so we had older adults who were we call them trained they do 14 000 steps a day quite considerable the normal adults they do around 10 000 i i was surprised that they call it normal adults i think it's quite active but let's call them normal adults for now and the third group is impaired adults so they have clearly a less active lifestyle we have less of them in this group only six and that's of course because if you're an older uh impaired adult you you typically don't favor a muscle biopsy um so it has been very difficult to recruit uh these individuals so we take muscle biopsies from all these people and then we do targeted metabolomics we end up with around 140 different polar metabolites that we that we analyze and this is basically a description of the data we see that many of the metabolites that we measure in the muscle biopsies if you compare young versus old so this is not subset of for the activity categories but just the younger versus the older is that there's quite a lot of metabolites that are higher abundant in the in the older one older individuals and also a bunch of metabolites that are reduced in the older individuals and so higher and the younger and the one that stood out for us for obvious reasons is nad which is in this heat map representation is high in the young individuals and reduced in the in the older or i shouldn't say reduce i should say lower in the older adults the interesting thing is that if you subset this for the activity profile so with this here i call them athletic so this is the active elderly the normal elderly and the and the impaired older adults you see that there is also this stepwise uh lowering of nad with the young individuals being high then if you're an athletic older adult this sort of is the same level of nad but then with the normal older adults and impaired older adults actually the nad is much lower so this is interesting i mean it's a confirmation basically that in a human cohort we can also find these kind of changes that we for years already knew that were happening in in animals and we always assumed that this would be the same in humans now we have the confirmation [Music] [Applause] you
