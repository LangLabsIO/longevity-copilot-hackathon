[Music] there's an aspect to bre breath work that is unappreciated and that is the changes in oxygen in your body and depending on how you do it uh you can either have higher levels of oxygen which uh will ramp up yourselves give them more energy and and your neurons will fire strongly or in fact you you can even by holding your breath uh have a a burst of what we call hypoxia which is also can be very beneficial to cells um um and when we go running that's hypoxia and that gets your your muscles to uh wake up and and your capillaries and and the blood vessels to also wake up and and grow more of those vessels so you have better cardiovascular health often it's confusing for people should I have less oxygen or should I do Hyperbaric or increased oxygen which which is the right one and what science says is most likely what's is that both are helpful in the same way that you're putting your body out of the normal homeostatic normal range and it's responding to this hormesis like effect a little bit of what doesn't kill you makes you stronger and in my lab we've we've been able to show that as we get older we have more hypoxia in the body uh and the muscles actually start to get locked into what's called a pseudo hypoxia State they actually think that they're stared for oxygen when they're not really in that downregulates their energy production through their mitochondria and through giving those mice nmn we could reawaken those cells and get them back to a normal state of perceived correct oxygen levels which in the body is about 2 or 3% oxygen not 20 in the atmosphere and really what what I think is going on is when you do this this breath work or exercise or hyaric oxygen is your stressing the system and getting it to reset back to a more normal level um and that's why we do all of those things uh the breathing we do hyperic oxygen we do a little bit of exercise I think that I speaking to myself I could do a lot more aerobic exercise but all of those things Ching oxygen levels are good for [Music] us a
