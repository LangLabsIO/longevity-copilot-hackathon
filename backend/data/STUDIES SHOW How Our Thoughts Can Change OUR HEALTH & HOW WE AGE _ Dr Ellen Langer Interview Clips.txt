[Music] we went on using that same mind-body unity idea to do um other exciting studies so go fast forward to 2007 which is still now a while ago we did a study with chamber maids and it turns out if you ask chamber maids do they get any exercise they say no because they think exercise is what you do after work and they're just too tired so we take these chamber maids we divide them just into two groups and we teach one group that their work is exercised we show them that making the bed is like this or that machine at the gym and so on so we have very two different groups now one thinks their work is exercised one continues not realizing it's exercise we take lots of measures there's no difference on how hard they're working how much they're eating and things like that but on the important measures we get what we were expecting we find that those who now see their work as exercise just a simple change in their mindset they lost weight there was a change a decrease in waist to hip ratio on body mass index and their blood pressure came down simply from changing their mindset we have lots of these studies um another one and you know i'm i'm strange i know that so when i'm in a doctor's office and they're giving me the snelling i charge those people just take it you go down the chart the letters get smaller you tell the physician what the letter is to me i say wait a second you know here they're building in an expectation that soon i'm not going to be able to see so go ahead and i do a study with my students where we reverse the eye chart so now as you go down the chart the letters are getting larger thereby creating the expectation soon you will be able to see and when that happens people can see what they couldn't see before for most people you think you're going to have difficulty seeing around two-thirds of the way down the regular chart so we start the chart a third of the way down so two thirds of the way from that are much smaller letters and again people can see what they couldn't see before and remember as i said before that in the counterclockwise study we also got an improvement in vision so many of us you know we expect you go to the doctor they give you a number and then you just assume that's true which is you know to my mind silly you know that if i'm hungry i can see that restaurant sign much further away in the afternoon i don't see nearly as well as i do in the morning when i am you know fully awake and so on um so our vision as everything else changes and at some point in this interview i'll tell you about a series of studies with chronic illnesses where by attending to those changes rather than mindlessly holding things still people can heal all sorts of um problems that now they only seek medical help in order to heal what the first set of studies testing the mind body unity idea we're all taking advantage of our mindlessness so let me give you an example of another one to make that we had people who have uh type 2 diabetes show up for a study and we're going to have them play computer games and we told them what we want you to do is change the game you're playing every 15 minutes or so to look at the clock next to the computer that was just to ensure that they'd look at the clock what we had was for a third of the people the clock was going twice as fast as real time for a third of the people the clock was going half as fast as real time and for a third of the people it was real time the question we were asking was would blood sugar level follow real or perceived time and it followed perceived time we had people in a sleep lab they wake up they see the clock the clock says they got two hours more sleep than they got actually got two hours fewer or the amount of sleep they got and again biological and cognitive functioning seems to follow perceived sleep rather than real sleep all of these things saying that our thoughts are very very important to uh to our health and well-being [Music] [Music] you
