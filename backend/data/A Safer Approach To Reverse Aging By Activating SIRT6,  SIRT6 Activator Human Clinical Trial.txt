[Music] so in here we thought well if silt 6 is important uh for you know that silencing transposals packaging things into repressive heterochromatin let's see if it rejuvenates mutilation age so this was done in collaboration with Steve forwards um we took cells from older subjects uh and then we express 36 in these cells for two weeks and then measure mutilation age uh in control cells and in cells that were expressed in third six and you can see that in nine out of ten um cell lines that will each one derives from a different person or a methylation age went down after just two weeks of six over expression and when we did RNA sequencing of these cells and looked at what the transcription patterns have changed you can see changes related to chromats in linear confirmation change chromatin accessibility DNA packaging so all those things we discussed are relevant towards 36 may be doing and then we thought okay well this was we overexpressed that six with the transgene uh can we stimulate it chemically and of course because 6 was known to extend lifespan in mice for some time uh people were looking for six activities but most efforts were focused on 60th situation activity that I mentioned a little bit earlier but from the analysis of centenarian Celtics we found that this activity actually may not be important for longevity but the other one reposition was enhanced so what we did here because we wanted to find activators of reposition activity uh so we took from the literature several chemical activities of silt6 that were reported to activate the acetylation activity and we asset them uh whether they will also activate representation activities and most of them did absolutely nothing like this mdl800 didn't change a thing but there was one molecule that was a very strong activity of both and this is an interesting molecule it's called fukuiden uh it was first discovered by ruin muado it comes from seaweed so it's a it's a polysaccharide that's abundant in seaweed so this is the brown seaweed uh and um it's a polysaccharide composed of these Focus sugar monomers but there is also some heterogeneity because it's a natural product so it can be sulfated it could also have Branch length so different species of brown algae produced somewhat different for Credence and we screened many different for quarters from different seaweeds and we found that about um one third of what we screened activated so since the rest didn't do anything uh and then we decided okay let's see if it has some effect in Vivo so we gave a fluid and that is a 36 activator uh we give it to aged mice so we obtain mice at already at 14 months of age so they're already starting to get free with this age and we fed them for Croydon for several months so this experiment is ongoing uh and we measured Frailty score which is very similar to the trail Discord that's you know used for people so there is walking speed grip strengths all this combined in a single score and you can see that myosin for quidden had significantly low of reality scores and here we are going you know like two months three months four months so mice are getting older the Frailty scores are increasing but those that are taking cereal supplement are still looking much better than the control mice so these are some pictures of the mice well for code and control so they they start to look old but the fukuidenma is really looking better and um you know there is still a lot of work to be done um to understand exactly how this folkoidal activates your six to maybe find better small molecule activators but to summarize my today's talk what I can say that there is this process of epigenetic drift with the age of epigenome unravels and opens up uh and there are different strategies and this process is probably the underlying cause of Aging that causes you know many other things to go wrong so how do we reverse it so there are different approaches that include putting epigism back together very drastic approaches epigenetic Rejuvenation with yamanaka factors but we can also use uh safer approaches for example stimulating six and not changing cell identity but just packaging epigen you know especially reduce effective elements back into heterochromagine and right now we are also gearing up for a small pilot clinical trial so we will be giving fukuiden that activates suit six uh to cancer patients when they're recovering from chemo because this is the time when people really need to put their pendulum bags together after being exposed to radiation of chemotherapy so during this time we will give people fukuiden supplement and then we will measure um different you know Health um perform different Health assessments uh Frailty scores like we did for the mice blood chemistry and of course epigenetic mutilation clock and see whether um fukuiden also helps people [Music]
