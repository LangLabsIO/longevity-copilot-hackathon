[Music] but as we age our testosterone decreases uh more than potentially muscle mass our libido our vibrancy our potential mental acuity as we age and the loss of muscle mass especially for men over 60 or 70. logically it would appear if our free and other measurements of testosterone are decreasing as we get older shouldn't we take testosterone supplementation but i know that you're a little bit of maybe not well the reason is that there have been a lot of studies on testosterone and health in old age and there isn't any evidence that your longevity will be increased by testosterone now what will happen is you'll for men you'll get more muscles if you work out with testosterone you'll slow down your loss of muscle mass which is a percent or two per year as you get older i'm 50 now so i know how that feels the reason that i'm not a big fan of long-term testosterone supplementation is partly because it hasn't been shown to extend lifespan but more importantly testosterone is a signal to the body that times are good times are uh it's time to grow instead of hunker down and survive and i do worry that if we artificially boost the levels of testosterone then it's going to counteract those longevity mechanisms but i'm not completely down on it you know i think it's it's not going to hurt if you take testosterone and build up your muscle that's all good i mean if you fall over when you're 90 that's you're basically done for and if you have muscles and you've exercised and stretched then that can save your life so testosterone has its place but what i like to do is and what what's working for me tremendously is working out going to the gym lifting very heavy weights using the big muscles in my body my hips my legs and my testosterone has doubled over the last few months because of it and that's naturally produced testosterone how do you feel about hgh um i don't feel strongly either way again it's short-term benefits you can see those long-term i don't think that's going to be the way to go again because the growth hormone is telling the body that you're getting a lot of nutrients time to grow whereas we know that true longevity in old age is the opposite signal [Music]
