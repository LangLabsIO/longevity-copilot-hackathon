foreign so [Music] but now then there are other interesting things that i do i eat a lot of plants uh we've discovered that there are molecules in plants besides resveratrol that are healthy and we actually think that these molecules are signaling to our body to turn on these natural defenses we call it xenohermesis xeno hormesis remember hermesa says what doesn't kill you makes you stronger xenomeans from other plants and other species and by eating plants that are colored and stressed and by stressed i mean they've been picked when they're dehydrated or too much sun or or organic foods they're typically more stressed than those that are in under under pesticides those give us those molecules that i think are add to the other things that i mentioned nutrients uh first of all we have a theory that uh bears out which is eat foods that are stressed stressed out uh which is a weird concept right but we do it naturally we drink some of us drink red wine which is a stressed grape before we pick it we often eat colored foods so spinach is a dark green food there's blueberries which are dark the wider ones are not as good so why is that well stressed food produces a lot of what we call xenohermetic molecules and i'll explain what that means it's a terrible word we coin but xeno xeno means from other species and hormesis is a very important word you gotta remember the word hormesis because it every day you should think about it hormesis is what doesn't kill us makes us live longer and uh it's a term that means you've got to get your body out of its complacency you've got to trigger those defenses those longevity genes so xenohemisis is you don't have to only run and eat well at the right times but you can also get these molecules from the right animals and plants but particularly plants that are stressed because when plants are stressed they're making these molecules of health for their own benefit right they're trying to survive they're turning on their longevity genes we forget plants have longevity genes too so a stress plant will make these colored molecules to protect from uv and dehydration when we eat them they trigger our own body's defenses and you can get the benefit so that's nutrition colored foods stress foods organic is stressed right you don't want the perfect lettuce that's been not put any stress and we need to do more of that we need to let our plants stress a little bit before we eat them so you're you're stressing your body it's like what do i do and what it does is it starts to like change gene expression that's one of the main things it does where it starts to turn on all these genes involved in you know helping your body deal with stress because you're stressing it and it's like freaking out it's like what do i do it's like okay i'm just gonna like i'm gonna do this like whole thing where i just go around and turn on all these really good genes that help me deal with everything until i figure it out right so it can be beneficial yeah absolutely so you said that turmeric does something similar i think in one of your yeah so there's um what this process i'm talking about is is often referred to as like hormesis right like a hormetic effect where you're putting a little bit of stress on the body and and the same goes for exercise the sauna cold shocking so higher intensity interval training is another example exactly high intensity interval training and also some of these plant polyphenols so tumeric egcg from green tea quercetin found in like onions so do you intermit that so my question i had sorry i have one question for you i know it's your show i feel bad um on the turmeric side like is that something that you would do intermittently then or would you because some people take it daily as a supplement and i was thinking well if you're doing that every single day and your body gets used to it is it going to turn on those gene expressions then that's actually a good point but yes it does because it is slightly toxic to our body our bodies don't like tumeric uh it's it's some of the compounds some of these curcuminoids in the turmeric are made as a response to the plants to fend off like insects and you know fungus and things are going to kill the plant so or the root i guess it's not really a plant right it's rude it's a root right yeah um so our body uh doesn't like it it's slightly toxic it just like you know alcohol is slightly toxic but as a consequence it activates all these phase ii detoxifying enzymes which are involved in preventing your body from converting something like nitrite in your bacon to nitrosamines which are carcinogens so we have all these enzymes in our body that are capable of detoxifying i hate the word detoxify because like a lot of woo-woo people use it but we actually do have enzymes in our body called phase two detoxifying enzymes yeah um and so they do serve a purpose but not only that um tumeric also so there's two really interesting compounds in it one is the one that most people are familiar with right so that um is the curcumin right and that's the one that turns on all these anti-inflammatory genes these phase two detoxifying enzymes all that good stuff but there's also something in it called aromatic tumerone which is why specifically i like to get turmeric or make turmeric tea not just curcumin because aromatic tumerone has been shown actually just in the past year to cross over the blood-brain barrier and increase um i think it was in the sub-ventricular zone increased neural stem cell proliferation and it affected like memory and performance in in mice and so this is like all preliminary you know but and it was like a very robust like it was like something very robust i'm not going to say the numbers i don't remember but it was pretty significant increase in new uh neural stem cells which is kind of your area but yeah very interesting that's what my thesis was on how cool actually the svv uh the sub particularly okay so that you know more about that than i do but the fact the fact that this aromatic tumerone in turmeric is in is in turmeric it's it's also very interesting do you add black pepper to your tea yeah so black the piperine the component in the in the black pepper can so our bodies like to get rid of these polyphenols and a lot of them like egcg a lot of them are on the same class there's certain enzymes in our liver the cyp enzymes that get rid of it so that's why their half-life is very short when you when you get tumeric in your body it's immediately your body's immediately trying to clear it out because it's toxic it's like no get rid of this you know um but the piperine stops that enzyme from working so you really have to be careful for people like you guys are very health conscientious and probably don't you know take prescription drugs or things like that but a lot of people do and prescription drugs are also metabolized to that same pathway so if you are taking a prescription drug probably best to avoid piperine because that will extend the half-life of whatever drug and god knows what that's going to happen right so that's always something to keep in mind [Music] [Applause] you
