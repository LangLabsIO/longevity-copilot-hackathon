[Music] it depends on how old you are and what your medical problems are but what i did do because i kept telling everyone there's no magic solution for everyone everyone's different um and no one would accept that answer so i came up with my my ideal list which i call the panacea um and this of course is in book one and i've got a few additives now to this but at baseline anyone over 40 should be on the panacea and this is it's easy to remember because i'm really good with mnemonics so the p panacea stands for patera still bean which is the cousin of resveratrol they're both sirtuin activators and they do a variety of other things as well um but this is step one you've got to turn your sirtuins back on um there was one paper that suggested that terrastillabean was not as good as if you had increased uh cholesterol so it's it was one one paper i don't know if it's true or not anyway choice is generally resveratrol or patera stillbane um we need to make sure that we get one that's bioavailable because otherwise the resveratrol bio availability is very low but they are making it in like new packaging nano my seals et cetera that does make it significantly better but that's agent one so everyone needs to be on one of the two of those um e-a panacea a is for astaxanthin astaxanthin is the most amazing free radical scavenger that we have it comes from algae that are angry they're pissed off by their environment they create this orange goo that makes the allows that cell to survive under stressful conditions and it honestly does the same thing for us anyone can take any i guess usually it's anywhere between four to twelve milligrams there's no harm in taking any more of that i wouldn't imagine unfortunately it does make things pink anything pink in the marine system is probably because of astaxanthin so roseate spoonbills their feathers are pink because of of this stuff quail eggs or coil eyes are red because of this salmon is red because of astaxanthin so i think the only fear of taking too much astaxanthin is turning colors but if you're okay with that then sky's the limit um so p-a-n and nicotinamide is the next one most people under 40 are nicotinamide deficients within the last year or so they came out with a home kit so for the low price of 300 bucks you can find out what your nicotinamide level is um i would assume that anyone over 40 is going to be statistically low it's just a matter of how deficient you are um the the world knows for the most part or longevity people know that everyone's deficient so there's a war on to get you to take their type so there's nicotinamide riboside there's nicotinamide mononucleotide those are the two orals and then you can get nasal sprays trans transdermal patches you can get injections you can get your iv dose it probably doesn't make a whole lot of difference how you get your nicotinamide as long as you get your nicotinamide um so that's let's uh p-a-n and then there's two c's there's carnosine carnosine is a natural dipeptide that we all have in our bodies so this is actually a supplement and not an adjuvant because we're supplementing our own internal source men have more than women and young people have more than old people so by the time you're an older lady you are carnosine deficient vegetarians are going to be kind of carnosine deficient because it comes from mostly meat products especially like turkey and chicken and that sort of stuff um but what it does is it's a trans glycosylating agent so it reduces the damage done by glucose in your cells so glycation is one of those major problems depending on if you're diabetic or not a pre-diabetic but we all love glucose but by reducing the damage done and reducing the age load um that's only beneficial so the top five has to include some sort of trans glycosylating agent and then lastly in this pile is carnosine i'm sorry curcumin curcumin is one of the best anti-inflammatory agents we have and again it does other things as well but um it's super amazing in terms of reducing your inflammasome and the problem of course is that their bioavailability is limited so there's been a war raging for last decade probably to make it more bioavailable so if anyone is interested in buying it you need to write read the label and it will say high bioavailability i'm not out to push any brands i could really care less but if it's going to help you you can't take the regular stuff it has to be high bioavailability um so that's top five of the standard panacea [Music] you
