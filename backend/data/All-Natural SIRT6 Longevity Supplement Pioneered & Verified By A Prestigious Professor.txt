[Music] we are studying this um sir Twins and the particular Circle in six which is a very important longevity Gene and we were looking for molecules that activated we found and actually was found even before us but people were looking at activators of their situation activity of structures and they found different compounds and then we founded two and six has another activity called modern education so we tested which activator molecules activate that activity as well because we find that better activities may be even more important for human longevity and we found the seaweed and the compound in seaweed is called for poison which is a short hmm sugar polysaccharide a very potent activator of certain six it is found in brown seaweed and the people that consume a lot of seaweed uh you know the countries that consume a lot of seaweed would be Japan South Korea and these are countries with the highest life expectancy so all of this kind of comes together there are many different species of seaweed I think in general seaweed is good for you from you know it has many different nutrients that people been using so probably any seaweed has some benefits but in terms of activating certain six this compound is found in certain species of brown seaweed and we in the laboratory tested different batches of seaweed because if you just you know buy CV that would be from different oceans and different locations so they are not all the same and from you know if you take 10 batches maybe three of them will have a strong activity activities so we tested in the laboratory we find that some of the budgets have stronger activation um so we we don't yet know exactly what determines it you know maybe really conditions under which this field was growing how much sunlight it was getting well so of fukuiden in general you know it's possible to buy it as a supplement um but of course in that case you still don't know if that will be a good activator or not so we collaborate with the supplement problemity company do not age and we test for them batches of seaweed so you can buy from them so six activator that we tested you know we don't test like it every day but they send us a sample from every new lot that they get and we test it activates and six in this case you can get a product that's been verified you know it is a it is a polysaccharide so it's it's food it's very safe we know that it activates your 26 and I said when six is an enzyme uh that is in the nucleus of every cell and it is responsible for maintaining um our DNA packaged in the right way um and when we get older so two and six may just may not be enough of it to maintain our DNA in good shape and by maintaining in good shape I mean that it's not only it helps repair mutations uh or damage but also it just helps keeping it organized because you can imagine DNA there is a very low molecule and this is like if you have a you know it was a thread and it gets all tangled together so it needs to be very well organized uh and as we get older like every cycle of cell division DNA gets unraveled and packaged back together or every time a gene is transcribed again it's to be opened and put together so it gets messed up it's almost like you know if you fold laundry in your sock drawer it will be a young it's all very nice and organized but over time you go in and out pull things and then it becomes a mess can do it can go back and just organize things back together um so what um seaweed can help here is that it just provides a boost to cell six it activates it and it can be you know a little bit more efficient in doing its job where it needs this help as we get older because there there is more more laundry to fall at that point will long-lived people have highest six activity or would it benefit humans to have higher self-six activity and here I want to show a family of centenarians so this lady is 115 years old in this picture and these are five generations of her descendants and now the ashik is holding her great grand great great great granddaughter uh in her arms so these people call centenarians uh there also many of them are exceptionally healthy they live independently they maintain employment and come back to the office almost to the age of 100 so they don't develop or they develop very late these age-related diseases so we want to really achieve that for everyone why any everyone couldn't Live 215 and stay healthy like that and see five generations of descendants so we collaborated with the laboratory of Houston TSU who was sequencing genomes of centenarians and we looked whether there are any mutations in this gene36 that would be more or common in centenarians and we found two mutations in the C terminals of 36 protein and about the same region where we had differences between Mouse and beaver so we took those two mutations we engineered them we tested how they affect the function of cert6 and this is a DNA repair assay We compare so this would be the wild episode six like all of us in this audience have and this is cell six from centenarians so it was better at inducing DNA repair so that makes sense right so Betadine repair longer life uh it was also better at maintaining heterochromatin so these are this is our genome and the only a small fraction of it encodes for genes like very small everything else are these repetitive elements or so-called genomic parasites lines and signs that actually unravel as we get older and third six keeps them silent so we compared uh wild type 36 and centenarian civil six and how good are they at keeping line one element silent and since nine was better so it was better in these two different functions that are very much linked to longevity and the way it was achieving that uh was by binding to another very interesting protein called glamine a Juan Carlos mentioned laminae in yesterday's talk so this is a very important protein in maintaining the structure of the nucleus which would be the structure of that sock drawer and here said six binds to it and the centenarian one binds more tightly and helps to maintain the whole structure more efficiently so we still come to the same the same idea of maintaining epigenome so this is you know the process of Aging this is the bad thing that happens to our epigenome but now we have strategies to reverse it to achieve epigenetic Rejuvenation there are many different ways that can be developed to descend Juan Carlos was talking about yamanaka factors also laboratory of Juan Carlos and Manuel Serrano are looking for other ways for mycological ways to do the same thing we also find these epigenetic factors like cert6 that their job is putting epigenome back together so that may be another strategy and this way we can actually not only slow down aging but achieve rejuvenation [Music] thank you
