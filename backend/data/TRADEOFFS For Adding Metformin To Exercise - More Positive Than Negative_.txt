[Music] I just want to make a this is an important point we are assuming that if we get all the gero Therapeutics on top of each other they'll be synergistic I think if you gave a great example right the guy who took everything I I also have examples like that well okay I I don't think we can be sure and and this was a this is a cute example because the master trial took elderly and gave them exercise with or without metformin okay and what they found that those on Metformin had had less muscle mass significantly less muscle mass they all gained muscle but with metformin you you gain less muscle so they published the paper in supplement four of the table by the by the way of the paper they actually showed that that there there there's no significant difference in the Improvement of knee extension maximal isometric contraction power relatively strength for me it says that this gram of muscle is much better right if you have less muscle and you don't have any Force change okay it's much better and indeed we showed that the transcripts that are related to mtor and enter is what builds muscle okay the the transfer related to mtor were decreased by metformin on the other hand with metformin you had other transcript that regulated autophagy map kinase cellular senescence and other so basically they're trade-offs okay they're trade-offs and it and there's some antagonism here if you're young and you want to develop muscle don't take Metformin by there I don't think that forming is good for young that's another thing you know there's antagonistic philosophy right what's good for you when you're young it's bad for you for your old I think some of the Therapeutics are bad when you're young metformin lowers igf-1 level I don't I don't know that that's good you know um I also remember this is looking at the muscle but metformin just like exercise have so many other effects okay on health okay it's not only about the muscle [Music]
