[Music] so there are Pathways in your body controlled by your genes that turn different enzymes on and off and they control all of your homeostasis so cerin I mean it's it's really silly they're they histone deases I mean it doesn't seem like they would do much they take light they take acetyl groups off of L I mean that's it it doesn't sound very fancy but they're sort of all over your cells and they turn they're basically they directionalize which way your cells are going um so sir twoin one again I I love the word cellular homeostasis because this is what you lose over the course of time and they control it they control your circadian rhythms you know we always hear that people as they get older can't sleep at night well your cin are deficient you fix your cin you're going to go to sleep that that's a no-brainer it controls your oxidative stress it controls where your fat gets deposited you know as you get older people say you know I exercise the same I eat the same why is why am I fat around the middle well you're ceru in deficient um so so one is The Mastermind of all of your cells um within so one six and seven live in your nucleus uh three four and five live in your mitochondria two sort of flits around your cell um six is really interesting because six controls all of your uh DNA for the most part it controls if it's heterochromatin or ukin meaning like all sort of like ukin is well hard to describe if it's all mushed up versus kind of spread out it's your DNA sort of spreads out and gets mucked up after a course of time but you want it nice and organized and that's controlled by um by C six all your DNA repair mechanisms are controlled by cert six uh in conjunction with cert one but six is incredibly important uh and then C three is The Mastermind of your mitochondria so if you are c three deficient uh your your energy levels are going to plumet so it's all sort of correlated so you you sort of focus on the serans what do the cin need once everything's turned on then you got to fix everything else so it's it's all very sort of um uh Interlink they all overlap like I like to divide things into seven piles but in reality they're all sort of crisscrossing and and very interrelated these are like the grand Masters right must say this is what we're going to do right that being said if if if what if you don't have the ability to do it then it doesn't matter with the grand Master says right other hand like so everything has to sort of be in its place right like if you activate your C two and three to say okay now our our mitochondria are going to be optimized your mitochondria will be like well you know what we're nicotinamide deficient I can't do this quite sorry right or yeah our mitochondria like okay we're turned on but we're making far too many free radicals so we just blew ourselves up well that's not good either so it all sort of works in conjunction um and I and I am being sort to and obsessive because I was just trying to find ways to maximize s two and three and six and I'm very excited because I discovered that fucan which is a um a long molecule that you find in seaweed it's extremely good at activating SE six like oh that's fantastic it does a variety of things other things as well but I'm like oh my God so now I'm like a seaweed addict um that'll pass uh until next week because now I'm working on heat shock proteins and then I'll be obsessed with like whatever that one is and it'll just get thrown on the pile um but it's just it's just very important that we address sort of all of these issues but yes cellular homeost or the control of cellular homeostasis as the master Regulators [Music] essential
