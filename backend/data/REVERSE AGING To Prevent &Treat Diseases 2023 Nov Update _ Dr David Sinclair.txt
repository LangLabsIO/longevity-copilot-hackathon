[Music] good to see old friends and lots of uh new faces as well I love how there's a new generation of scientists coming into this field um and even just 10 years ago as Morton and Alex and Danielle can tell uh tell you this field really was was nowhere um in fact when I was starting to work on Aging medicines or longevity medicines it was widely regarded as as a crazy thing to be doing so it's it's really I got to say really um know emotional to be up here today thank you but you're not here to to listen to me talk about my emotions you're here to see some data and so I'm happy to share some some new data with you um I'm not going to talk about a few things that have been happening um I think that's you know can I only talk about one main topic so I'm not going to talk about the NAD work unfortunately I'll give you a quick update NAD boosters uh the main one that's being uh developed into a drug at metrobiotech has been in humans for 3 years is showing efficacy we've published a couple of papers on that already and others have shown similar results of lowering cholesterol lowering blood pressure and improveed what looks like improved endurance like we saw in the mice we're seeing something of a signal in humans so I'm not going to talk about that and you know my name's all over the Internet with NAD I don't don't sell NAD supplements by the way but a lot of people think I do but I want to want to talk about and focus on today is um what is a new topic and an old an old topic it's it started my career and it may very well end end my career uh if hopefully there isn't an end to my career except uh at my funeral I want to keep doing this so uh those of you who were around 30 years ago will remember that the epigenetics of longevity started in the around the mid1 1990s largely based on work in yeast cells which I was very fortunate in fact unbelievably lucky to land in a lab the lab of Lenny gy at MIT Brian Kennedy who's here was the postdoc who was oh no graduate student I forget he he was he was already so uh mature he taught me how to Wrangle yeast cells this is an old yeast cell in yellow I've stained it with brenol blue it's acidic and Brian taught me how to study yeast cells and and those were some golden years we had four years where uh collectively as a group you know I won't go into exactly who made the discoveries but but Brian initiated the project Matt cine came in shinmi who discovered Ned and the sort of two in connection um it was it was a golden age and uh many of the scientists in that group went on to become famous scientists in their own right what we discovered in those days and this is I'll give Brian credit for discovering the Sur 442 mutation which led to the seruan field as we know it now the seruan field was interesting because when we first discovered it or when Brian uh came up with this finding of Sur 442 it made no sense we were thinking we're going to find a gene involved in DNA repair or a gene involved uh in antioxidant activity instead out came this silent information regulator number four what the heck that makes no sense nothing to do with aging right but o over the next 6 to 12 months we started to figure out that there's probably something to do with silencing and and aging and controlling of gene expression and uh we propos Brian uh proposed that there's an age Locus which turned out uh we discovered is the unstable ribosomal DNA but all of this is now history what's more important is what did that teach us about our own aging and that's what I want to tell you today um so cins um if if you don't know are epigenetic Regulators they dealate um proteins the lysines and proteins including histones and in doing so they can regulate many proteins including um the compaction of Chromatin and the reason I mentioned um I said that the cin field is interesting is that we got distracted as a field in the 2000s now we did some good work as a field we found that the environment controls the uin the amount of glucose the amount of uh temperature amino acids we linked a lot of signaling and environmental inputs to the ceran activity but what we really didn't focus on for a long time and we should have is the epigenetic role of cin we were more interested in mamalian cin controlling p53 and nfca B and isn't that really cool it all makes sense but really what bugged me as a scientist was what about the epig genome what is going on in mammals there and so what we've come up with and I'm just going to jump to the chase before I show you data is what we're calling and others have called the information Theory of Aging so what I'm trying to get across with this theory is the following that aging is not just a breakdown of our bodies right we're not just cars that wear out and then we die and we try to fix little bits and live longer what this Theory says is that there is encoded in every cell information that keeps the cell Young And as what this diagram is showing is that there's what we believe now to be a backup copy of that youthful information in every cell um I used to give the analogy of a scratch compact disc that got a bit old and I didn't want to explain what a CD was to young people every time so now the analogy is more like rebooting the software in an old computer and this is based um in concept on the work of Claude Shannon in the 1940s and 50s in the information theory of communication where he proposed that there may be a backup or we should make a backup copy of every signal of information that we send out radio waves and now the internet and now we've got the tcpip protocol of the internet and what I think we've got now is an understanding that there's a tcpip protocol of biology that there's a backup of youthful information encoded somewhere and we have we think we we know where uh though that'll maybe next year we'll talk about it um where that information is stored and we can access this using increasingly um easy ways so I'm going to talk about two ways to reset a cell epigenetically and get back the youthful information one is genetic means and we'll talk um about yamaka factors to do that and you heard Sharon last night tell you that we're already in monkeys and improving Vision using yamanaka factors to rejuvenate the eye and we're also going to at the end of my talk talk about perhaps much cheaper ways than gene therapy to reverse age um this is an old slide but I love it um this is by Yan V who you heard this morning um and Yin Su and others um published in sell this was a summary of a paper that Philip oberdorf or a postu in my lab published in in cell um back in 2008 and what we did was we said okay what's going on in yeast cells is the movement of cin to the R DNA where there's genomic instability and that distracts the seru from what they should be doing which is silencing genes such as the mating tyloo which control control sterility and that's a Hallmark of old cell sterility and we thought well you know we're not yeast cells we're not going to necessarily just get sterile from the movement of cin but maybe in principle it's the same that genomic inst stability distracts the cin from their main job of controlling gene expression and perhaps they don't come back to where they originated in full and over time it's like a tennis match where you lose the balls and you have to go collect them um so this paper was the result of many years of work uh of Philip and our colleagues showing that that principle is true in mammels that the cerin in the nucleus um we focused on ct1 ver goranova I think as you know has done a great work on ct6 uh moving to DNA brakes and helping repair um and the movement may actually mess up gene expression over time and as you can see here it's also a very active process this movement of seruan to repair um broken DNA requires signals such as ATM and h2x so this is not just an accident this is an active uh mechanism now you might say well why would cells do that why would cells mess up their epigenetic software over time why not just put put it all back where it came from and we don't know but my theory or my idea is that this is is a very adaptive helpful response so when cells get damaged there's a response epigenetic factors like the cin and probably many others pars go to help with the damage there's a signal they go temporarily go there and that's coupled with transcription so that genes that are involved in repair uh and metab metabolic uh changes in response to damage coordinately get expressed so in this system we saw that c one leaves to go where it it's needed to repair DNA and these genes that were once silenced by the cerin come on temporarily such as D repair and met metabolic changes more glycolytic and then if all goes well then the cin come back the DNA repair proteins get shut down because you don't need them around as much and Metabolism goes back to normal all great but probably what's happened is that we haven't been selected to live beyond you know about 50 60 years and uh and so the system works pretty well for young cells and young organisms but not so well when we're old and that's known as antagonistic plot tropy as you know and it's perfectly consistent with that so what are we doing now well we wanted to test this Theory not just look at what's happening but test whether this is perhaps a cause of Aging not just something that happens during aging and to do that we built a mouse that I've been talking about for 13 years so I'll go quickly cuz you've probably tired of this mouse fortunately we published it finally after 13 years we got it out there in January the ice Mouse stands for inducible changes to the epigenome what we did was we mimicked genomic instability by cutting the chromosome rarely in a mamalian cell or a mouse and we showed after many years that this does not cause an overt accumulation of mutations in fact we could not find mutations that were caused by The Cutting of this enzyme called pop1 um and also one of the criticisms of the paper by some is that this is probably causing cell death because it's causing DNA damage well actually we design this system to be very very mild these cells do not die we see no evidence of apoptosis in the cells or in mice when we turn it on we typically turn it on for 3 weeks and it's I call it chromosome tickling because it's really it's not a lot of DNA damage the cells in fact when you grow them in a dish they don't even slow down in their cell cycle and they don't show uh on a western blot a DNA damage response right p53 does not become phosphorilated even when you turn on this cutting enzyme cells can deal with it really well but it's enough to tickle them so that the cin get distracted and 3 weeks later we've got a change in the epome but not a change in the genome that's very important right we know that mutations can help Drive aging but we wanted to separate damage to the and changes to the genome from changes to the epig genome and using the system I believe that we've done that so now we can ask the question do do changes to the epigenome have anything to do with aging as well and the answer that we came up with was probably because the mouse that was treated when it was young for 3 weeks with this system did have epigenetic changes that we can see that are very similar if not identical to normal aging transcriptomics we did proteomics we did mapped most of the changes across the histones and the mouse you can see on the left there is the one that was treated 10 months beforehand and then we think we initiated a domino effect of change to the epome and the kind of things that we saw in that Mouse were very similar to Mouse aging so we can also look at very precise changes to how the DNA is folded and modified that's what this slide is showing but I'm not going to go into details but these red lines show DNA DNA contacts and after the treatment with the The Cutting enzyme and everything's repaired if you do the genome you say there's no difference DNA is the same but if you look at the folding of the DNA with with these red Loops here big differences okay and so we think or at least we're testing the hypothesis these changes to how DNA is arranged in cells is a major driving of disease in mammals and you you can read this so I'm not going to go through each one but we looked a lot of different tissues with our collaborators there were 64 scientists 15 different labs around the world raford Caro's lab helped us greatly among others who are here we looked at the clock with um with vium and uh uh in Steve Horath you know we're looking at bones we're looking at eyes we're looking at skin muscle and every time we gave tissues to another lab they came back and said yeah this is aging okay including the epigenetic DNA methylation clock which was invented during the study so just to finish up now we're going to ask the question if you can give something to an animal can you take it away if you can give aging can you reverse it and so one changlu who now is at MIT as a postto was a very brave student he took on the project it was circa 2014 and his project was to find the backup copy if there is one of youthful epigenetic information and he almost gave up because we were trying genes that were involved in embryonic development of course we tried all four y artifactors we kept getting chenis we didn't want to cause tumorogenesis we wanted youth but no further we didn't want to go back to age zero um and he almost gave up and he was uh I think he wouldn't mind if I told you that he was to the point of tears in my office and my job as a professor now is not to do the work but just to make sure that my students don't quit and uh and this was one of those moments where uh Wan Chang was ready to quit and I said is there one more experiment that we can try cuz my gut tells me after all these years that we're on to something I just don't know what yet and he did a killer experiment that worked instead of putting the four y arch refactors in which is what yamanaka himself won the Nobel Prize for in 2012 um and also I should credit the Belmonte lab who had shown in 2016 showed that if you pulse the expression of four yam artifactors in a mouse a a progeroid mouse you can extend their lifespan so we knew that that was true but foram and artifactors is overtly toxic to Human and mouse cells okay unless you pulse you have to be very careful not to cause tumorogenesis or death but what wanang noticed discovered to his Delight was that using the three yonara factors and leaving off Mick we could drive cells back 75% in age but no further there was a barrier to getting back to zero and this was our breakthrough we maintained the cell's identity actually we regained the cell's identity but we didn't go so far as to eras it and so he did a really great experiment which was to now go into an animal this is in gang her lab where he does this model of nerve damage now we chose the eye uh not because it was easy but because it was hard and also because Gene therapies are already approved for the eye and we thought if this does this works hey we could try it in humans and so what he did was to pinch the optic nerve of a mouse or a few mice and have a look if you reverse the age of those uh cells what happens and we know that if you damage an old nerve uh it doesn't grow back but if you damage a young nerve it can grow back and so this is the control the no treatment optic nerve on the right is the eye and the left is the brain and you can see without the orange die a lot of the nerves are dead after about this is after 6 weeks the optic nerve is largely dead otherwise it would be bright orange but after turning on the three yam artifactors that was sufficient to not just protect the cells from dying in and we turn this on after the damage so this is not just pre-treatment we can do it 24 hours 48 hours after but these nerves also started growing back to the brain and in fact we left them for 16 weeks and many of them went back to the brain this was unprecedented but this isn't aging this is wound repair um so we did glaucoma with Bruce cassander um and his team and glaucoma worked mice got better at seeing and then I said um to Bruce can you try aging and you know most scientists who have never heard of studying aging think this is a crazy thing uh but I pushed him and I said just try it I've good got a good feeling about this again and so he did old mice and this is some figures from the nature paper that came out in 2020 so we use adno Associated virus to deliver three of the yamanaka factors it's doxy cycl inducible and you'll have heard Sharon last night saying the treatment that she's going to try in humans will be doxycycl inducible so you can you know get your vision back hopefully and then repeat every few years in these mice we can do that and uh we treat them for four weeks and asked can blind mice be made to seea again um before I get to that result we looked at the DNA methylation in these cells and it was largely restored versus the control this is now genome wide methylation uh we worked with um Morgan LaVine and and vium Steve to look at methylation age and it was younger in the treated cells in Vivo this was the figure that blew my mind I did not expect this this figure shows that there truly is a backup copy of youthful information in Vivo why because if there was no memory of youthful gene expression those dots which is individual genes would be flatlined across horizontal but the fact that they're along the diagonal means that the cell knows which Gene to change the expression and in what direction and by how much that's that's three bits of information in there and as I said where that information is stored we're actively looking uh the mice got their Vision back we now know we can do this multiple times and one of the surprises uh nice surprises was that the changes to the DNA meom were very similar to the injured eyes that we had done previously so what I believe is that aging uh can be driven uh By epigenetic changes that can be accelerated by a few insults to the cell that we know of one is DNA damage or double strandard breaks the other is crushing cells which is what I showed you uh vums lab has now shown that stresses to the body even pregnancy can change biological age so I think we're starting to see that aging is a manifestation of cells freaking out in response to damage including DNA breaks and that uh is a driver of of of Aging um I want to show this again in case you missed Sharon's talk OS treatment of non-human primates improves their vision and so this is a model of of uh of stroke to the back of the eye in a monkey and the results which are very clear is that these are electrical signals at the back of the eye and the treatment with without the yamanaka factors those mice sorry those monkeys are blind they have a lot of nerve damage when you look at them but after we let them uh after we treat the monkeys with the OS a lot of the neurons survive and the electrical signals are largely restored now we don't know if these monkeys can see again because that's hard to to measure but there is no doubt that you can restore the function of a monkey's eye by reversing the age of those animals and so we're excited about testing this and people in I won't give a timeline but it's certainly within you know a short time frame as soon as we get enough virus and approval to do human studies we will initiate those we're doing just briefly cuz I know we're out of time we're doing work on the brain now so we're just about to submit a manuscript this is um Shan uh um shaan's work out of ver ganova lab who's in my lab now we grow organoids we can age the organoids out to age 70 within a week we can give them Alzheimer's disease model of Alzheimer's then we can reverse the age of those and using this little system here we can see that the electrical signals of these organoids cerebral organoids come back again we can express OS now in very specific regions of a mouse's brain including neurons of the hippocampus and what we can see is that those mice that are treated by age reversal of the hippocampus get their ability to learn again and we have some hint that even lost memories are recovered in those mice uh so what I've said is that we think we can reverse the age of cells epigenetically we can use Yaro factors it's going to be expensive even if for Works gene therapy is not going to be available to everyone on the planet so what I'd like to see is something for $10 that we can all take to rejuvenate so the final slide that I have is uh some advances that we and others are making around the world to reprogram cells using chemicals and The Field's going super fast we put out a paper with vm's lab just a few weeks ago in aging um and this is using a an essay that looks at the Integrity of the nuclear nuclear pore complex which is of course important for aging and these are some of the chemical structures uh of chemical cocktails that reverse aging in cells and we we'll be testing this in Vivo shortly these are the controls on the left here these two and then using transcriptional clocks which viim lab has has developed you can see that each of these six chemical cocktails reverses transcriptional age of these cells and these are just different clocks that they're using so I believe that we will be able to reverse the age of cells at least gentically using chemicals I believe that we'll be able to one day do this for $10 and we'll be able to do it multiple times throughout a lifespan so just to finish up um we've got evidence that uh when you damage a cell physically um perhaps even metabolically there will be changes to the epigenome and that this is reversible through I think what's one of the most remarkable discoveries in a while the cells have a memory somewhere of epigenetic usefulness that we can tap into uh so lots of people as you can see helped and these are just some of the highlights on the left are the people in the lab who I mentioned along the way we've been helped by many people who are here at this conference um I apologize if I didn't mention you I'm very grateful to everybody who makes this [Music] possible
