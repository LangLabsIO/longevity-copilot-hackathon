[Music] with an abundance of caution of course I'm taking these NAD this NAD booster um in the hopes that it's going to pan out the same for humans um I take vitamin D which I've learned goes down way down during winter I'm testing my levels as I said uh what else do I do I take um a drug called metformin which is typically given to type 2 diabetics now why would I do such a thing because I don't have diabetes yet well one is that it's in my family and I would get diabetes if I didn't watch out but also because metformin in some large studies uh retrospective studies of populations have found that people uh who take Metformin are relatively protected against not just diabetes but also heart disease and cancer and Frailty and even Alzheimer's disease so I'm taking that one for those reasons um there's one called berberine which is quote unquote people call it poor man's metformin and berberine you can buy off the internet but um for metformin I have to warn people you do need a doctor's prescription prescription to get that drug here in the U.S well I was actually um thinking that it would only be a good thing but I had my last uh test comeback from inside tracker and it was through the roof it was exceedingly high above safe levels according to them and so I've cut way back on my vitamin D in B intake so yeah I I think what's important about this what we call bio tracking or at least self-monitoring is that if you take something unless you have a test you don't know if it's working or you know God forbid doing you harm and that's another reason for this personalized medicine Trend I think it's it's really important to be able to see what's going on not just on the outside but on the inside [Music] foreign [Music]
