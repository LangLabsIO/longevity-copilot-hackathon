[Music] well they definitely are now i've seen some good data on that now what we do is what they do is that they put an iv typically straight into the vein and give sometimes just a few hundred milligrams or a bit more than that into the bloodstream over a period of an hour or so i tried it recently so i can now speak with some experience um and like most people i experienced tightness in my in my tummy around my intestines uh it wasn't too bad wasn't anything that i was worried about and then it subsided uh pretty quickly afterwards within just minutes and i felt fine um i've also had it injected intramuscularly inserted my back side which did seem to to help with a problem that i was having with my muscle there but uh what do we know well we know that nad levels go up but the problem with this treatment as i see it in terms of its potential long-term benefits is that the levels of nad go up fast right within an hour or two you're up double triple levels but then it'll go away and unless you're having an iv drip like that every few days uh you're not going to have the sustained levels like i do uh over my lifetime of having um raised the overall baseline okay so if i was to draw it i'm a very visual person so i'll do that for you let's start over here um so if you're taking a drip you're going to be like that and then next week like that whereas for me if i start taking nmn for um a uh 10 days it'll steadily rise and it'll hit the peak and then it just wobbles like this during the day uh and controls the sleep weight wake cycle by the way animen is i find um very helpful for my sleep wake cycles um so what's the bottom line there's really a paucity of data on nmn ivs now could they help for sure i think that that there's some evidence that raising an ad levels even for short periods could boost your body's ability to heal so i'm not poo pooing it i'm just i would love somebody to do a real clinical trial with a placebo um and that's easy to do right um well relatively easy but nobody's doing that as far as i know uh if they are please you know write to me let me know and i'd be happy to look at some data and until i see data data driven i can't make any conclusions [Music] you
