[Music] so what is time restricted eating people get confused all the time they think it has to do with skipping breakfast or changing the dietary content or quality of the food but it's really aligning dietary intake with the body's circadian rhythm and it's really important to human metabolism at the cellular and organismal level and then the other point of confusion is the term intermittent fasting so people think that any type of fasting is restricted eating and it's not there's a lot of different ways that you can fast one is alternate day fasting where you have a day where you basically have minimal caloric intake followed by a day another day where you have normal caloric intake and then within time restricted eating there's a lot of different types of strategies so for in some studies the period of eating is eight hours in the studies that we've done in my lab is the period of eating is 10 hours with 14 hours of fasting and the reason we do that is because from a safety perspective it's very feasible in patients who have metabolic syndrome and who are on multiple drugs such as anti-hypertensives uh it does not cause any adverse effects such as hypotension or hypoglycemia and a 10-hour eating window is much more easy for patients to adopt and sustain long term so when when we hear the term intermittent fasting we really want to be more more focused on what what it's referring to whether it's an alternate day fasting regimen or whether it's time restricted eating and for patients especially patients on multiple medications some of these more aggressive regimens are not safe i have had patients who've done alternate day fasting have gotten hypotensive dizzy have passed out so it's really important for patients on medications that we guide them to safe strategies this was our study that showed that in patients with metabolic syndrome that when they engaged in just one change to their lifestyle and that is engaging in time-restricted eating with a fasting window of 14 hours and an eating window of 10 hours that there were significant improvements in cardiometabolic parameters including weight waist circumference a decrease in blood pressure a decrease in ldl cholesterol and non-hdl cholesterol which is an important substrate for atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease a couple of surprising findings to us is the improvement in glycemic control especially in hemoglobin a1c and also in improvement in restful sleep one of the things that we leveraged in our study is the use of continuous glucose monitoring so for my patients with diabetes this is a technology that i've been using for many years but now what we're seeing is in our clinical studies that continuous glucose monitoring can give us a lot of insights in the patients who have pre-diabetes who have impaired glucose tolerance and there there are a lot of derangements that conclude continuous glucose monitoring can pick up that even conventional parameters such as hemoglobin a1c do not pick up because what you get with continuous glucose monitoring is you get response to caloric intake so for instance in this patient what you see is certain foods such as a a dinner that has a burger fries and a milkshake causes a spike in glucose not only is there a spike but the duration of the spike is prolonged so in this particular patient for instance if you got a hemoglobin a1c it may be normal because it's an average of glucose over a three-month period but what you see here is that there is abnormality in uh in glucose levels after a meal so it can give you a lot of insights and we're leveraging this technology for a lot of our our clinical trials what we also saw in our trial is that after a regimen of type time restricted eating patients who had elevated a hemoglobin a1c really improved overall and here is an example of an improvement in cardiometabolic flexibility or cardiometabolic resilience what you see before time restricted eating is a significant increase in in glucose especially post meals and what you see after time restricted eating is how that increase is is blunted and stays within normal range so you can see here how a simple lifestyle intervention is really improving cardio metabolic flexibility and what we've seen is the benefits of time restricted eating go way beyond weight loss so many people think that time restricted eating is just a way to inadvertently lose or restrict calories but what we see is that yes there is some slight restriction of caloric intake on average about an eight percent decrease in caloric intake but the benefits of time restricted eating go way beyond just caloric restriction so in our studies with time restricted eating we see a reduction in body weight but what we see is that reduction in body weight translates to a much higher reduction in ldl cholesterol so there are other mechanisms at play beyond just caloric restriction there is also a decrease in improvement in body composition another thing that we see that is very interesting is in a subset of our patients who have non-alcoholic fatty liver disease which is also a big driver of cardiovascular disease is that there is a regression in liver fat with time-restricted eating when we think about non-alcoholic fatty liver disease we are often thinking about it as a liver disease but in fact most of these patients actually die from cardiovascular disease so this is really a disease that we need to be thinking about more and it's a disease of obesity and decrease in weight can help but we are also seeing here that just the lifestyle intervention of time restricted eating can also decrease liver fat so time restricted eating is a simple lifestyle strategy and the reason that i say it's simple is because the instructions that we give to our patients are much less complicated than the instructions we give when we ask them to engage in caloric restriction or other type of dietary regimen what we tell them is limit your caloric intake to 10 hours a day and we also give them some flexibility so it doesn't have to be exactly the same 10 hours a day so for instance if they're having a later meal with family they can adjust their eating window the next day and just start breakfast a little bit later and so what we're seeing not only from our studies but from studies of multiple groups is that there is a decrease in body weight body fat abdominal obesity there's improvements in blood glucose levels improvements in atherogenic lipids such as ldl cholesterol which are a big driver of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease there is a decrease in blood pressure and one thing that i'm impressed with is the decrease in diastolic blood pressure which is often hard to achieve with just medications alone and mechanistically there is improvements in oxidative stress biomarkers and biomarkers of inflammation i also find very fascinating that there is also improved improvements in the microbiome and this is an area that really needs to be investigated further that is to look at how does time-restricted eating or fasting impact the microbiome so a very uh potent lifestyle strategy that we should be recommending to our patients with metabolic syndrome to improve their cardio metabolic response [Music] you
