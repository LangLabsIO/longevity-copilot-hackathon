[Music] okay so what about instead the diet that should be uh used every day so we we've been focusing i call it a five pillar system i don't want to go through the the the all the five pillars but let's say if you look at multiple disciplines in science and put it all together epidemiological studies study the centenarian clinical studies basic research study of complex system um you come up i came up with this and you know really reflective of hundreds and hundreds of studies so the longevity diet uh so other than what i just told you this fmd periodically maybe three times a year um the uh mostly plant-based diet but you can be vegan and you can be very healthy but it's not easy to be vegan and healthy and so you know for most people i recommend it's possible so uh but for most people i think eating fish a few times a week is recommendable um and low protein intake but sufficient low but sufficient so there should be about 0.8 grams of protein per kilogram of body weight so if you weigh 50 kilograms that's about 40 grams of protein if you weigh 80 kilograms about 65 grams of proteins so and the diet should be high complex carbohydrate and healthy fats so then olive oil the nuts and then lots of vegetables lots of legumes um high nourishment omega-3 vitamins minerals this is very important that the body has all the nutrients it needs and then 12 hours a day so keep the food intake for 12 hours a day don't go much longer or much shorter so stay right about so 8 a.m 8 p.m 7 a.m 7 p.m so eat within those 12 hours and no and not outside of the 12 hours and then i say for people that are and that we're starting a large clinical trial of 500 people now in southern italy and so for people that are overweight obese or tend to get there have breakfast skipping breakfast is not recommendable always have breakfast plus either lunch or dinner and then substitute either the lunch or dinner with a small let's say less than 100 calorie snack it could be fruit it could be a some nuts um it could be you know a small salad or something like that um i i think there's nothing wrong with the mediterranean but if you look at the meta-analysis of the mediterranean the the change the effects of mortality are small you know i think cancer is about six percent lower um i think neurodegenerative disease is the highest one with about 13 uh difference you know compared to all kinds of control diets so uh yeah i think i don't think the mediterranean that goes far enough but the mediterranean diet uh if somebody sticks with it and also depends what mediterranean diet we're talking about right but they say a very sort of severe one that is being used by some of the studies that can be very beneficial uh so this is based on our own epidemiological studies but our own and then those that we did with with harvard and um and so it looks like it should be about 0.7 0.8 so well let's let's put it in in pounds you know 0.32 i think to 0.37 grams of protein per pound of body weight so somebody weighs a hundred pound there should be let's say at least 40 grams of protein 40 45 and if somebody weighs 150 pounds uh now they could go to 65 grams and there should be pescetarians of fish let's say a couple times a week plus vegan and but watching lean body mass so it's good you know say once a year go see somebody that can do phase angle measurement and lean body mass measurements make sure that you're not you know accumulating fat and losing muscle um and in which case you know then then that level i mean not just the level because the vegans about 20 30 of the vegans are can be malnourished at the amino acid level they can have fairly high levels of proteins but the amino acid composition especially in the legumes can be deficient in a variety of amino acids and and so um yeah so those populations tend to be um tend to be uh at least part of them part of the vegans tend to be malnourished for protein so um and there's a study that just came out showing hip fractures going up two and about almost two and a half fold in vegans compared to a realistic risk for hip fractures to an unfolding vegans compared to the meat eaters you know just to give you an example but the pescetarian not the case at all small changes uh in in i think one type of fracture and in most cases there was a trend for lower fractures in the pescetarian group compared to the meat eaters [Music] you
