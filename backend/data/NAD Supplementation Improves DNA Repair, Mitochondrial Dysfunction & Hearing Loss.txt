foreign so with this correlation we deplete NAD pools and therefore all other in somatic processes that depend on NAD including sirtuins and many others and that can then be part of the process towards mitochondrial dysfunction so the model that we have generated has to do with this there is a lowering of DNA repair is seen in these diseases it's seen in Alzheimer's and it's probably also well it's known that DNA were better clients with aging so part of the Aging phenotype could also be this mitochondrial dysfunction we have DNA damage accumulating in the nucleus also on the mitochondria but because of various findings we think that it's a nuclear damage that's particularly significant this pathway here and it is in part because some of the proteins that we have deficiencies are in the mitochondria and others are not but they have the same phenotype and then we see this correlation increase depletion of NAD of sirtuins mitochondrial dysfunction and several kinds of mitochondrial health problems notably mitophagey which we have particularly been interested in and we have then used various interventions mainly NAD supplementation with nicotinoid riboside and nmn but also your lithium a which we have studied as a we screen for my autophagy stimulation Alzheimer's and we found that urolithin a was a very potent stimulator mitophagy so now we're comparing Pathways and features on behavior and also various other bioinformatics on the stimulation of with your lithium a versus nicotinamide riboside approaches and with this and these models with NAD supplementation we see a lot of improvement of these features that I mentioned before and also NAD has a direct effect on DNA repair so it has a mitochondrial stimulation mitophagy mitochondrial Health but it also improves the DNA repair function which is of interest to us this work has then led to that there are a couple of ongoing clinical trials we have incocking syndrome and in Warner syndrome and at this point we don't have any results to show but it is ongoing as often disease intervention and we've recently found cross-species in worms cell lines mice and human CS brain patient samples postmortem that there's a very severe mitochondrial phenotype in in in common cross species and we can improve that with NAD supplementation and actually in Mouse models this was Morton's finding several years ago that we could improve mitochondrial parameters by giving the mouse mice NAD and a nicotine riboside so we have been studying these Pathways in Alzheimer's and in normal Mouse models and other diseases and focused on some census which I would like to discuss a little about here because I think that we were trying some interventions in these particular using census we've also studied the microbiome and just published a paper showing that the microbiome is severely changed in Alzheimer's mice what dramatically improved after NAD supplementation so it it really improves and normalizes the microbiome Spectrum so I'll talk about some hearing studies that we've done and this is cochlea in our ear where the hearing occurs this is the snail and the sound goes through here and increasing frequencies and in the cochlear from CSA and csb mice we reported a little while back that there was a lower level of NAD and in in in in in in the cochlear from the inner ear from the mouse models both CSA and csb we then did an intervention study here and in this case it's only 10 days that we're giving NR in the drinking water and we looked at the hearing how it changed do we use the ABR which is a standard technique used to measure uh the uh the hearing in in humans as well and you get these brainwave activities they're using this approach and here is what happened at five weeks of age you see that the csb mice have less hearing at the 32 kilohertz level and then after the next 10 days of giving CIA NR the csb mouse has not lost any further hearing whereas the one that's untreated has lost further hearing so we completely blocked the progression of hearing loss in the csb mice both A and B genotypes and so we've explored the mechanism here of a good deal further so we're also doing a hearing intervention in Alzheimer's Mouse models and we have or developed a specifically uh interesting Mouse model and Alzheimer's that's DNA repaired efficient and when it's DNA rapid efficient based on some findings originally in patient material then you see more Alzheimer's development faster Alzheimer's more severe symptoms suggesting that DNA repairs protective of Alzheimer's and also we see increased hearing loss early on when you deplete DNA repair and Alzheimer's models compared to the Alzheimer's Mouse that's normal so to speak and um in Alzheimer's studies we've done a number of things to look at function of NR and again we see a very dramatic Improvement of synaptic transmission here using long-term potentiation with electrodes electrophysiology showing that the 80 Paul beta Mouse and proves to normal levels when you treat them with NR so we're very interested in how in our works at the mitochondria how it works at the synaptic transmission Steve could you briefly comment on what is better and our supplementation or nmn I I can very I so this is really being widely discussed at meetings that I go to and there are two different camps as you well know and I would put it this way that in our studies nmn is hard to come by in larger quantities so for the mouse models we've usually used NR but for cells in nematodes and organisms we've used both when we look at the features that we're interested in we see the same results with NR and internet so I know there's an endless discussion about pathway differences and that is true but but that's that's the same in our hands now in addition we have so much safety work done with NR at this point that we I think know that there are very few side effects a few were mentioned at this meeting but very limited a lot of human studies done within a man there are different compounds being made by different companies at this time and we don't really there's one clinical study that suggests possibly no side effects but much less than with NR and so different compounds and less studies makes me think that for something that could be applied in humans readily you would prefer in our and do you take NR supplements occasionally I do yeah I mean I know many people that do but yeah I mean it doesn't you know it doesn't show several studies that have been done on in human studies we heard also here don't show any particular benefits on short term so I don't know I mean if you but it's possible that in some conditions with NAD is lower then you will have a big effect or that in long-term prevention but I'm not paid by any company so I'm just speaking from my experience and I get the drugs for free but I don't get any money from any of the company foreign [Music]
