[Music] beloveds what about food how much should we be eating and go back a thousand years um even 2000 hippocrates uh it was common knowledge that fasting was good for us and as consumers uh and companies were you know motivated to make us eat more we were taught and marketed at um so that we would eat three meals a day and snacks in between and you know you turn on tv and that's what everyone's saying you gotta eat all the time and that's a great way to sell a lot of products but it's also harmful and we've shown in my lab and in hundreds of labs actually around the world that you need you don't want to always be hungry uh full you want to be hungry some part of the day and as long as you're not starving or you're malnour nourished it's actually very beneficial now it's different if you have a disease if you have type 1 diabetes or some other metabolic condition that's different talk to your doctor about that but people like us who have regular metabolism eating three meals a day i think is the worst thing you can do um your body will eventually just become complacent not turn on the body's defenses and uh so you can actually feel pretty good by by being hungry during the day and we've shown in many different species from mice to dogs to monkeys that being hungry in the long run is very good for you and it's not just about what we eat right but it's also when we eat so you for example talk about how you don't normally have breakfast by the way i don't either my entire life i struggled with not wanting to have breakfast but being forced to have breakfast whether initially it was by my mom who said what do you mean you can't leave the home without having you know these eggs and milk and the rest of it you know oatmeal and i remember feeling nauseous and sick in the morning because it's just that's just not what my body type is i wasn't designed to eat in the morning and then again there's people who wake up starving like my little one who's i say little one she's 15. um you know she needs to eat she wakes up and she's starving she's um that's why i like the ayurvedic body types because they they do a good job of saying hey if you're a fifa you're going to wake up hungry and you should eat but if you're avarta which is what i am you're probably not interested in eating first thing in the morning and your metabolism gets going closer to around noon and that's what so i get famished between noon to four i'm just feasting i get so hungry i'll go through two thousand three thousand calories without a blink like it's insane how much i can take in but then i'm done at six and i really can't eat after six i'm just full well what what i've learned but that i think is really fascinating um by monitoring my blood i can see why i don't want to eat in the morning ah i have a body type where just as i'm waking up in the morning i my body makes its own sugar oh yeah so i don't need to eat it's crazy and i my mother would also force me to eat breakfast when i was quite my body was making its own food so you know that's uh we have to learn that we all have different body types that honoring ourselves not listening to every stimulus out there every ad every commercial every study but really going inside and listening and honoring what your body is saying to you i think it's just the most important step one in getting to greater health at least that's been my insight does it matter whether we finish our dinner by six or by ten uh you don't want to eat late at night um typically because the the period of fasting that's beneficial uh will extend through the night and uh i'm i'm prone to snacking late at night uh it's it's stress uh relief for me but i try not to i try to finish eating around eight o'clock at night some people try it earlier um but that's it's good for me because i skip breakfast and so that gives me that whole 18 hours of of not eating a lot is that the magical number 18 hours well there is no magic number um i think that probably it's it's important to to go without one meal a day uh either evening or morning so you get that long sleep cycle but uh you know honestly that we we debate this all the time about which is the best diet and some people say fast for three days fast for a week two days a week 18 hours we really don't know but what i can tell you it's similar to exercise that doing nothing is the worst you can do a little goes a long way what's the minimum period of fasting that's truly a fast oh gosh uh that it's it's a spectrum but i i would think if you forced me it's more than 12 hours because we know that we don't eat during the night and uh so the average person has always fasted for 12 hours a day uh typically and that doesn't give you more than an average life so you need to go beyond that so i try to do 18.
