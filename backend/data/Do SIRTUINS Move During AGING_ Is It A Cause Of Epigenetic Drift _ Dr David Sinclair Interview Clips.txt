[Music] the early 1990s now brian kennedy nick ostriaco deserve a lot of credit in 1994 just as i was coming to the us from sydney australia they put out a paper in cell that said that the sur-4 gene sir standing for silent information regulator information is important in that acronym they are that mutant in a yeast cell was able to extend lifespan and what then we showed with brian and i published a paper shortly thereafter when i got to the lab was that the reason you get this protection from from aging and longer life span is associated with and because there's a relocalization of the sur protein complex away from silent loci such as these mating type loci and telomeres these are heterochromatic and they move to a site of genome instability which in yeast um and in our cells but in yeast we studied it it's the ribosomal dna and the ribosomal dna is very repetitive about 150 copies end on head to tail and we could see the move there and we could mimic this effect by just breaking the chromosome really anywhere we wanted to and we saw the most of the sur's complex moved to the break and that included the protein called cer2 which gave rise to the family of certain proteins now sort of i'm not going to talk about much more again i just want to tell you that they control heterochromatin we know because they they take nad as a co-substrate molecule which is changing during levels during aging and in response to what animals eat and then they deacetylate histones to compact their chromatin we also had a look at what happens during aging in a mammalian cell is there something like this going on in other words do sirtuins which are have very specific places at about 400 silent genes and repetitive dnas in mammals including transposons as well retrotransposon do they move during aging and can we promote their movement by creating a dna double-stranded break and it was it's actually known that chromatin reorganizes in a quite dramatic way in response to double-stranded breaks but what isn't known is what happens to the rest of the genome does it affect heterochromatin does it affect the epigenome and are there permanent changes after the repair has happened even if there's no mutation left behind and so uh this is the concept that in a young cell you have this pattern of loops and bundles that control gene expression if we create a break in the chromosome of a mammal will we get relocalization of those proteins to the break yeast says yes we had to test it um and then over time if you repeat this uh you know many hundreds of times and consider that in our 26 trillion cells in our body this happens at least once per day so that's a lot of breakage over time do we get this disruption so we could test that in cells and we could test this in mice which we did and this um was a review that came out um it was in cell by jan if you say correctly and what he was describing was a study where we created breaks in mammalian culture uh mammalian cells and in mice and we found that the relocalization required these uh dna damaged checkpoint proteins so this wasn't just a random drift that this really was an active process that required phosphorylation chemical modification of the actual histones at the break and it's one of the first steps the movement of cert one which is the homologue of the so2 yeast gene that i talked about this enzyme gene product the enzyme moves to the breaks recruits repair proteins and then most of it goes back to where it came from and we could see this also recapitulated during aging this process of moving away from the cert one regulated promoters this enzyme was very useful to us it's been used to study dna break repair for many years in vitro but we started to use it in vivo i use it we use it in our lab because it doesn't cut very often there's only about 18 consensus sites across the genome it does cut the rdna which we had to be very careful we weren't just trashing the genome but it's been very useful because it stimulates a very very mild damage response in fact it's so mild you can barely detect any activation of these factors by western blot you won't see p53 activated for example it's we call it chromosome tickling to distinguish it from other types of study [Music] you
