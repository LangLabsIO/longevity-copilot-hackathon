[Music] yeah right um so mtor is a a complex of proteins that senses certain amino acids so if you eat a big steak mtor will be activated and it will turn on your body's ability to make protein right that's what you need you eat a steak you make it into amino acids then you make your own protein uh the problem if you're always eating meat is that your m tour is always on and if you're if you don't have low levels of mtor sometimes then mtor won't start to clean out your cells so m2 is very important for what's called autophagy or autophagy which is the chewing up of old proteins that accumulate the best example of a disease that is caused by accumulated crystallized proteins is alzheimer's disease but all cells accumulate these old proteins and uh so mtor is very good at turning on these deep cleanse de-cleansing processes but if you're eating meat every meal you're not going to turn that on and so that's that's the main thing about mtor there's a drug called rapamycin which is used for transplant rejection low doses seem to be taken by some people in the hope that that will clean out cells and give some health and longevity um it looks promising rapper logs as they're called molecules like rapamycin and rapamycin itself have greatly extended the lifespan of mice and worms and yeast so it's arguably the most potent drug that we have against aging right now you know the caveat being it's not perfectly safe but that's how that's how mtor works so mtor and sirtuins and ampk they all talk to each other uh we used to fight in the field about whose pathway was more important than the others and the mtor group was against the sort of but the reality is that if you tweak this the mtor pathway the stratuans will change and vice versa um so there's 2 and 37 of them they're found in a variety of places in the cell there's three in the nucleus there's three in mitochondria and there's one floating around in between and they take care of telomeres they take care of cell survival repair dna damage the list goes on they even control how how much fat we put on so they are essential if you have mice that have more solutions they they tend to live longer and number six surgeons seem to be very effective but the problem for the sotuns is that they need this molecule called nad to work and as we get older we have less and less nad and uh if you look at skin of a 50 year old like like me the levels of nad are now half of what they were when i was 20 uh assuming i'm an average human being and uh so that's scary that means the sort of defenses against diseases and decay are only probably half as active as they used to be so that's why i take nmn which has been shown in humans to raise the energy levels back up to youthful levels and the hope is that people who do that myself included will have the defenses and the rigor um of a much younger person uh and we'll see you know proof's in the pudding right it's a long-term experiment um i still got hair i'd see perfectly and my mind is intact but uh you know if if i come back in 30 years you know and i haven't changed then something something good is going on but it's a long long experiment and an n of one as we call it is not a clinical trial so that's why in parallel i'm doing these very rigorous clinical trials at harvard university [Music] [Applause] [Music] you
