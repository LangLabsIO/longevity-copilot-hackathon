[Music] i think there's two main categories that the main approved category is for treating rare diseases or you're missing a protein typically and for example spinal muscular atrophy or sma is treated by a gene therapy called sulgensma and because they're rare it costs a lot of money to do the clinical trials and so that that has to be amortized over a very small population so silgenza is about two million dollars per dose making the most expensive category of drugs in history at the other extreme for a category of drugs which is very similar in the way it's delivered so you have a single gene or a single messenger already or single dna wrapped in a viral capsid or a lipid nanoparticle so you could see gene within a some kind of deliberate nanodevice so another category sort of the other end of the price spectrum are these vaccines so the top four coronavirus vaccines were two of them were double-stranded dna and a viral capsid and two of them were messenger rna in a lipid packaging and those some of those were as little as two dollars a dose so two million dollars for a rare genetic disease and two dollars for something that everybody should be taking so there were actually uh four papers that we published all of them using gene therapy three of them used aav virus very small capsid one of them used cytomegalovirus but the main one that you're probably referring to was with well actually noah davidson was a postdoctoral fellow in my lab who's on three of those papers one of them was with the main one work that led to rejuvenate bio as a company was in pnas on using three genes in various combinations it started with around 50 genes 45 or 50 genes that we tested singly to see if they had effects and these were harvested from the vast literature on the subjects what we knew about aging was put to work and we asked of all the proteins that go down uh with age maybe if we boosted some of those back up they would cause reversal or make it easier to recover from age-related diseases and we prioritize of all the maybe say 300 genes that are involved in asia we prioritize the ones that look like they were going down with aging and would spread throughout the body so we didn't have to get efficient delivery to every single cell we would allow a little bit of gene delivery followed by a lot of protein delivery and so we we picked out of the 45 initial genes we picked down to three and then we tried every single and double and triple combinations on a variety of different diseases of aging i started out with four different diseases that were age-related they had very little to do with one another other than they were age-related diseases and then somebody heard about this and suggested a fifth one and now we're doing seven or eight of different diseases but again it's a good way of testing that what you're looking at is kind of one of the core components of aging rather than just some minor symptom of aging that you're providing some kind of symptom relief we want to really get at the core of it so you know that was the first paper of the four so i think aging research has progressed tremendously uh recently along with many other fields of biology and medicine partly because we're in the times of uh where we're getting the payoff of the exponential improvement in reading and writing dna and a number of related things that you can make if you can read and write dna you could make these other adjacent technologies and that's all spilling over into aging research and so it's come from a very kind of sketchy background you know where people were it was a lot of wishful thinking and hyperbole where people would hope that you could just change you know your diet a little bit you know or the fountain of youth to change your water source and i think that was naive i think now we have very sophisticated understanding of what's sometimes referred to as nine different pathways major pathways we have a lot of the molecules and those pathways will define i think we may have to get all nine of them at once to really because it's otherwise if you fix eight of them then the ninth one will kill you and fixing it all at once means combination therapy so again having one drug is not that going to to do it but combination therapy is not a not a completely foreign thought you know there might be five drugs that you might use in an antiretroviral therapy hiv there might be three or four that you use in a in a cancer chemotherapeutic setting et cetera et cetera so so i think it's going to be combination therapy is we're going to knock out all the pathways at once it might have to be a little a little bit personalized and it has advantages generic in that it hits multiple diseases in multiple people but there might be some personalization that's required as well if it's truly generic then it will be inexpensive just like the vaccines are you know i hope we get aging reversal gene therapies down to two dollars a dose the way that the vaccines are but in any case i think we can make it something that's equally distributed [Music] you
