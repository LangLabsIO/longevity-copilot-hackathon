[Music] magnesium is an essential essential mineral about 50 percent of the U.S population does not basically get adequate intake of magnesium and the RDA for adequate intake was set at around I would say on average it's a little different for for males and females but on average about 400 milligrams per day for an adult and um if you are a physically active adult so let's say you exercise frequently you are you know maybe using the sauna you can excrete magnesium through sweat and so a Physically Active adults actually require anywhere between 10 to 20 percent more than the RDA so you can imagine if people are already not even getting the RDA the Physically Active people are even you know in worse shape in some some respects and magnesium is an essential cofactor it's a mineral that is important for the function of over 300 different enzymes in our body everything from enzymes that are important for repairing damage to our DNA so DNA damage is something that's happening every day it's happening right now as we're having this conversation it's not something that you can look in the mirror and see but it is Insidious in in respect with respect to basically it causes this low-level type of damage that accumulates over time and as we age it can lead to dysfunctional cells it can lead to potentially what are called oncogenic mutations that can lead to cancer so repair enzymes do not work properly without magnesium also DNA synthesis so we're Main taking new cells we're making new blood cells we're making new immune cells we're making new skin cells every time we make a new cell we have to replicate all the DNA inside of those cells and that requires enzymes called DNA polymerases those are required you basically need magnesium for those to work properly you know so again it's a very important process for our DNA and repairing the DNA and making sure it doesn't get mutations from the get-go with DNA replication and it's probably why there's so many there's a variety of studies that have found these are observational studies of course all the caveats that come with observational studies like there's you know potentially other confounding factors but with that in mind people with the highest magnesium levels have a 40 percent lower all-cause mortality and a 50 percent lower cancer mortality compared to people with the lowest magnesium levels there's another study that um I think is specific to pancreatic cancer so for every 100 milligram decrease in magnesium intake there was a 24 increase in pancreatic cancer incidence so again you know sort of highlighting the important role magnesium plays particularly with our DNA and you know with respect to making sure the Integrity of our DNA the genomic stability stability of our DNA is is good and that's very important for preventing cancer which is an age-related disease it's something that you want to try to do everything you can to prevent of course there are things outside of our control however there are things that are in our control role and I think you know an easy thing would be magnesium so why is widespread deficiency common magnesium is found at the center of a chlorophyll molecule chlorophyll is the molecule that gives plants their green color so magnesium is high in dark leafy greens most people are not eating multiple servings of dark leafy greens daily it's also pretty high in legumes almonds are another great source of magnesium oats are a great source of magnesium so the bottom line is people aren't eating enough of their leafy greens supplemental magnesium is another possibility but you know the the dose of that is needs to be considered because magnesium at higher doses can cause adverse effects like GI problems so what I like to do is try to get my magnesium from dietary sources like this morning I had a smoothie with some cooked kale I had some chard in it I had Frozen a couple of frozen strawberries and blueberries and avocado so I was getting a magnesium dose with my breakfast right which was scrambled eggs so um you know having trying to find any way you can to get multiple servings of greens or almonds you know oats are another great great dietary source but I also do a supplement of about 125 milligrams of magnesium and I do magnesium glycinate most of the Magnesium supplements are with respect I would say the one that's not very bioavailable is magnesium dioxide but you could you know magnesium glycinates a really good bioavailability has very good bioavailability so does magnesium malate or magnesium citrate so this is in the with respect to supplementation with magnesium it can be a way to kind of at least get you up to more of an RDA adequate level also when I sauna when I'm physically active I also drink electrolytes after that and that's another so you can have an electrolyte drink that replaces some of the Lost sodium and magnesium potassium for example [Music] um
