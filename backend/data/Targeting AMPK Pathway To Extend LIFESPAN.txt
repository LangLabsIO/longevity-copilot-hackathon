[Music] foreign PK now ampk protein is activated by The Binding of adenosine monophosphate so when the cell is under energy stress so there's not adequate glucose intake calorie restriction cell under those energy stress so lack of reducing ATP but higher levels of amp would activate this protein because amp binds to ampk and activates it apart from binding of ampk and active getting activated ampk can also be activated by Upstream kinases remember kinases add a phosphate group and activate another protein um Upstream kinases Chi lkb and cam kinase so cam kinase is activated by the presence of intracellular calcium so calcium activated kinase calcium chlamodulin binding activates this kinase which then adds a phosphate group at this site three in one seven two on a and PK and that activates ampk now there are several research that's underway that looks at activation of ampk because aimed PK activity declines with age and several research articles have shown that ampk declining with age and if we have dietary example calorie restriction exercise activates ampk genetic ways to uh activate ampk and chromatological agents such as metformin can activate ampk this is shown to improve longevity now ampk process is a catabolic process or it promotes catabolic Pathways because as I mentioned ampk gets activated when there's an energetic stress meaning there's low levels of ATP so ampk will turn off Pathways that will use ATP and will turn on Pathways that will produce ATP mpk as I mentioned earlier would be activated by the ratio of the ratio of amp to ATP or ADP to ATP increases EMP is a central energy gauge so it can sense energy imbalance the whole body energy balance control that's how ampk Acts now aging is associated with decline in ampk activity and signaling there are ways to promote ampk signaling then we could potentially improve aging associated or prevents the onset of Aging Associated chronic diseases now apart from um apart from turning on all the catabolic processes ampk is also important in preventing fatty acid synthesis because ampk is inhibitory to a protein collar enzyme called as ACC acetyl-coa carboxylase so acetyl-coa helps in the conversion of acetyl-coa to Malin and COA which then promotes fatty acid synthesis now the ampk is inhibitory to ACC then fatty acid synthesis is curb and that's another important function of ampk because the absence of fatty acids or reduced fatty acid synthesis is beneficial because aging is associated with um you know excess fat accumulation which then signals and there's insulin resistant onset so all those can be prevented as well by activation of ampk now here once again an overview that just shows that ampk suppresses Pathways that consume energy and upregulates Pathways that will break down or kept breakdown and utilize or promote ATP production now this research on ampk Activation so in um this manuscript the authors were able to show that mouse that are older had severe outcomes after uh induced lung injury hemorrhage-induced lung injury the outcome was more severe the mouse had a harder time recovering than young Mouse what they found was this inability of older moms to recover was due to impaired activation of ampk the mouse actually had harder time even responding to um ampk Agonist a car the mpk activation was prevented and the mouse had severe outcome when compared to young males that shows how important ampk in aging so when the activity of ampk dwindles or goes down and then aging Associated emissions developed and that's different from a young Mouse which is able to recover from the lung injury and another research was we looked at calorie restriction on ampk activation so the mouse welfare or rats rats were fed a calorie restricted diet so that they were consuming only 60 percent of what they were consuming earlier and this went on for eight weeks so that resulted in activation of ampk and they also observed that activation of autophagy occurred you know activation of ampk can't result in inhibition of mtor pathway so that resulted in activation of autophagy and they found that the older Mouse when autophagy was activated they have improved consequences they this is their model from their paper then they attributed this ampk activation to improvements in autophagy which prevented oxidative stress buildup so as the rats Grew Older they had more oxidative damage that resulted in damaged kidneys and when ampk was activated by calorie restriction autophagy was enhanced which was able to get rid of some of this oxidative damage and that promoted Health in older Mass model foreign [Music]
