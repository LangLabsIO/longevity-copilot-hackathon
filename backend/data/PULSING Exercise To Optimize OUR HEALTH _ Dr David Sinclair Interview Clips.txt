[Music] prometheus is what doesn't kill you makes you live longer but then if you draw a graph which i like to do because i'm a scientist uh you you don't have any benefit if you're just sitting around eating and not exercising so you start to put stress on your body biological stress not psychological stress which is bad but biological stress you put your body in a state that makes it worry that it might run out of food or it might be chased by a predator and that's called phromesis and so you start to get benefits the more of this stress you put on your body so exercise and eating less often and eating the right foods and then you reach its maximum which we're aiming for which takes a while to optimize everybody's different and then you can overdo it and then you start to go down again and then you over exercising and not eating enough and not getting nutrition um and that's what i think we should talk about is how can we try to find that optimum for mises that perceived adversity that our bodies use to work really hard against aging and diseases and and make us feel a lot better as well you can typically tell because your blood biochemistry will be way off but if you're not doing your blood work your body won't feel right you'll feel over sore you'll you won't recover within 24 hours and you'll have inflammation in your body which you can generally see you might have problems with your skin as well so that's when you know you're over doing it in the case of exercise your blood by chemistry you'll have too much cortisol and you might have some protein uh kinase this is an enzyme that leaks out of your muscles when they're damaged but you also feel sore and if you're sore for many days and your joints particularly uh and even if your muscles don't recover then you're definitely overdoing it and i have um people that i know uh that i see their blood work and there are people that exercise every day and over do it and exercise for two three hours a day and then i tell them to to dial it back a bit maybe do three four times a week but not seven days a week and then they actually improve in their health that's when they've gone beyond that omnisis optimum someone like tom brady any athlete but tom is a good example we all know about him but he has full-time staff looking after his body and uh you know he will get a lot of massaging and and doctors on him all the time we don't the rest of us cannot do that so don't don't try to do what tom does just have to have a have these rest periods um and rest is just as important even even with supplements i tell people that a lot of supplements you shouldn't be taking every every day give your body a rest you know maybe one day a week at least and uh i do that i sometimes don't take supplements just to let my liver recover if that's being potentially uh stressed out by the supplements and um yeah so it's all about finding that optimum but not going too far and it's it's not just about how much but how often as well [Applause] [Music] [Applause] you
