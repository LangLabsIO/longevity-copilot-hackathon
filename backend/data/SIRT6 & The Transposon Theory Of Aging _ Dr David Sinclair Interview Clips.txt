[Music] foreign [Music] what do you think about the transposon Theory of Aging as cells get older transposition becomes looser just disrupting normal cell function is this the epigenetic change that you also describe as the information Theory of Aging um what what do transposons have to do with cellular function in this case there's a lot there's a lot and I do talk about it in my book which is uh a good thing so my short answer you can always read more um I I love it uh it's it's a very important component of my theory and uh so John ceterby and Vera gorbanova and Steve helfand deserve a lot of credit for recently showing in at least in animals and and possibly in people that the emergence of retrotransposons a lot of this repetitive DNA in the cell um drives some aspects of aging and possibly a lot of it uh in fact the 36 Gene that we've been working on for many years and first worked on in yeast cells in the 1990s uh is a major suppressor of of retrotransposons during aging and that if you delete the gene for sort six those mice go through Rapid aging uh ostensibly because those hellhounds have been released from the genome and uh so it does fit into the fit my Theory of Aging The epigenetic Theory of Aging says that as the as epigenetic information is lost in other words the structure of the three-dimensional nucleus is lost part of the problem is that genes come on when they shouldn't and that's not just genes that specify vision and neuronal function it also allows retrotransposons to be transcribed and multiplied and leak out into the cytoplasm where they cause inflammation um so it's a perfect part of a perfect example of how the information Theory of Aging includes and seems to explain many if not all of the observations over the last few decades in the field of aging and we haven't talked about senescence cells they're extremely important of course accumulating during aging and possibly by deleting them we can reverse some aspects of Aging in my theory the ultimate endpoint of a loss of epigenetic information the you could say the accumulation of epigenetic noise and the loss of solar identity and tissues is senescence the cell will check out stop dividing and sit there as a senescent cell so it could be that we need to use uh fasting and exercise mimetics such as metformin nmn arapa log for example to slow down epigenetic changes then if they do eventually accumulate we can delete those sentencing cells with a cenolytic and then ultimately what we want to be able to do is reprogram the body so that you don't get anywhere near that in the first place [Music] thank you
