[Music] one of the exciting things about aging research is that we've discovered that there are systems that keep us healthier for longer but there are also key genes that control that process there's mtor there's ampy kinase there's sortuans and these form a network that communicate with each other they sense what we're eating for exercising or if we're not and what they do is they send out the signals to the body to hunker down and survive for longer we think this is what's giving us the benefits of diet and exercise actually so what we want to do is find drugs that turn on these pathways that inhibit the mtor and activate the amp kinase and turn on certain that give us the benefits of diet and exercise and even beyond that in just a single pill we used to think that there was just one key pathway for aging and actually to be honest we scientists used to fight over which pathway was more important but actually it turns out we were all just blind monks holding different parts of the same elephant we realized that our pathways are all talking to each other but now the question is which of these pathways is the safest to tweak with a drug or do we want to tweak all of them with three different drugs for example and get a really big effect and those are the exciting things to explore in the future [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] you
