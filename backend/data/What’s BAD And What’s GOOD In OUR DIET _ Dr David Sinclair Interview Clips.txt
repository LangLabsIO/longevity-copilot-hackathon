[Music] but let's start with what's in the diet that's bad um clearly any type of sugar is bad raw sugar fructose sucrose bad carbohydrates i would try to not eat too much of unprocessed carbohydrates keeping your blood sugar levels at a steady level not too high is clearly important nobody would doubt that the other thing you you should try not to do is to gain too much excess uh body fat it's been showing that obesity lowers the amount of nad and lowers your certain defenses tuans and i control how fast we age and what we've discovered is that there are molecules in foods that we eat that activate these defenses in our body that these genes control what's fascinating just in the last few years is the same molecules that my lab and others have discovered control these longevity defensive genetic pathways are also the same kinds of molecules than food types that people studying long-lived communities these blue zones as dan buttner would tell you and so we're intersecting and coming to the same conclusion so for example the two in one gene makes an enzyme that protects the body it's activated chemically physically by a couple of really interesting molecules one is resveratrol which a lot of people know me for that discovery that's in the red wine molecule but more recently another lab discovered that oleic acid which is produced when we we're hungry and now fat breaks down but also we can get oleic acid from olive oil avocados uh nuts and it may be that the the benefits we get from those foods are largely because those foods are turning on our defense pathways against aging also the the three meals a day i've thrown out the window i try to skip breakfast or have a very small breakfast i typically have a few spoonfuls at most of some homemade yogurt i actually i buy a brand um no affiliation to me but it's called bravo yogurt which i make at home and then i mix my resveratrol with that every morning fruit is okay i drink a lot of hot drinks so teas and coffee not too much caffeine meals that's also good in you know in terms of immunity trying to keep hot drinks up so that pathogens get killed by the hot uh drink we we coined a term called xenohermesis and the xeno means from other species and the hormesis means what doesn't kill you makes you stronger and what it means is that when plants that you're eating have been stressed and i don't mean psychologically stressed of course i mean uh picked after being dehydrated or too much sunshine or pathogen or you know a worm i mean a caterpillar is eating it those plants will produce molecules that activate our internal defenses against aging and disease resveratrol is a good example of that when you pick grapes that have been dehydrated before the harvest they have the most resveratrol largely because the plants are trying to extend their longevity and survive and we ingest it and we think that we get the benefits so you try to eat plants that are you know not grown under perfect conditions so organic and also you try to eat plants that have got a lot of color in them and because these molecules tend to have color [Music] you
