[Music] so I'm going to start my talk to give you a little spill about NAD and NAD decline during Age and age related diseases okay it is controversial okay there are some Labs that don't necessarily see any decline in aging and all the tissues the amount of n decline varies but in our lab in many other labs I think Eric vergin here uh sees the Nika chain many others see there is some degree of n Decline and there is this functional pellagra that happens during aging but also happens during several disease States okay and there's plenty of preclinical data demonstrating that NAD levels appear to decline and be kind of the downstream effect of of several injuries what I'm going to try to uh to uh sort of present today is a couple of things that we've been investigating one how is this Ned decline happening so what drives the NAD Decline and then ask a really naive question so if NAD declines during aging is it sufficient to cause any of the phenotypes of aging and this is something that we don't know yet yet okay and obviously can you intervene on this Ned decline so our sort of um biggest Discovery happened about 20 years ago it was published in a very low impact Journal because nobody believed and I think that more and more and more uh I'm actually excited about things that people don't believe especially the ones that us okay don't believe okay that is against our hypothesis so this was a discovery that was done by Pinar saw in my lab that demonstrated that the number one the main enzyme that degrades n in Myan tissues wasn't the ones that you would expect such as par one uh or or CNS it was an enzyme called cd38 so cluster of differentiation uh 38 and as you guys can imagine this is actually an enzyme that is mostly in immune cells okay it's also present in endotelial cells and there's another really important caveat most of your n is supposed to be intracellular this is a Necto enzyme okay so there's actually even a topological Paradox but this is the enzyme uh we have been working with this enzyme for a very long time because this enzyme generates second messengers that regulate intracellular calcium nadp is the one that we discover when I was a PhD student also generate cadpr but its main function is to destroy an ad so to generate one molecule of this second messenger it will use 100 molecules of NAD okay and we publish uh now almost 10 years ago uh a paper in uh cell metabolis demonstrating that during the aging process this NAD decline was caused at least in part not completely by accumulation of cd38 positive cells so this was published by Juliana kamaro that now has her lab in Brazil um so we follow up with a couple of questions obviously which are the celles that accumulate CD3 during aging okay and what we found was what we were expecting okay the majority of the cells that accumulate C rate are immune cells so as you can see there uh on the figures uh you have young and old animals and then we stain for cd45 and cd38 and you see those clusters of immune cells that accumulate in the liver in the fat and then uh uh we uh we sort of figure out this is apparently driven by this immune aging process okay so this is our hypothesis so tissue decline was driven mostly by accumulation of those immune cells there are C8 positive so how do they get there and what drives them to come to the tissues so this was a paper that uh we actually um had a publication back toback with uh with uh Eric um on nature uh uh metabolism might be 5 years years now um it certainly was way before that that we started doing this work but essentially what we actually show was that senent cells were at least in part driving through their sasp through their secretory phenotype the migration and accumulation of those cd38 positive cells so sort of linking two potential key markers of Aging so in this EXP expent here um you know the first thing I'm actually showing you guys on the top is that young and old animals that's fat okay and they in red are c38 positive cells in yellow are actually the cells that are ccent and they are usually sort of clustered together okay then we ask sort of another naive question what if we actually inject normal cells or senescent cells in mice does it cause cd38 positive immune cells to migrate and this is what is on that experiment so you see in control we inject the control cells in the senescent cells we inject the senescent cells and you actually see that you see those clusters of immune cells coming to the tissue so here's again what we demonstrated on on on this paper and actually again as I said Eric validate a lot of this data on his paper that uh sessen cells through the sasp leads to activation of an M1 type uh uh uh microf fate phenotype and then uh those those cells are cd38 positive we further validated this uh by using this mouse model was developed by one of our collaborators um Jim Kirkland uh um Tamar Tona and uh and Ian vorson uh that are all on the paper uh and what we did was we took mice there are ink attack so when you treat those mice with this drug AP they they will selectively kill p16 positive cells okay and what we show there uh is that p16 positive cells are wiped out when you treat with ap cd38 cells positive cells also go away and then NAD levels are at least partially recover not completely but partially so again this is the hypothesis that we then generated that as the animals were aging there was accumulation of sence uh cells they secrete sasp and then they bring cd38 positive immune cells to tissue and that causes degradation but we actually show that it was an N the main substrate that was being degraded was actually NN one of the precursors of NAD the next question is unpublished okay and you guys are going to be the first ones to see this data actually not because I presented this just last week in here to the alliance on healthy aging so the question is can any D decline Drive aging okay and it is still a question I don't know the answer okay but essentially what I'm showing you guys there and if you work with mice this is a young Mouse and this is an old mice this is easy no big deal we all seen this okay people that have deficien of vitamin B3 do not develop maybe aging phenotypes okay they develop this terrible disease called pellagra but it might have some features that might have something to do with aging they have some kind of dementia they have dermatitis diarrhea and they die but I think one of the caveats about pellagra okay is that pellagra kills you very fast in 3 years four years you're dead so you might not have even time with fullblown pellagra to develop accelerated aging so we try to model some chronic pellagra in the mouths okay and uh tell you that uh uh we were very uh actually successful so Andreas benites is a fellow in my lab that's doing this work and this work is 7 years old now uh we were finally getting to the point of sending this for publication uh and this was done in collaboration with a group in Utah with merela and Ralph uh Meer uh uh f as you can see there we have generated a mouse model I won't tell you the secrets of the mouse model yet okay wait for the publication but we can't titrate any D levels in a young animal to the same levels in almost every tissue okay of an old mice and now we can ask a very simple question do they get old or do they look like old animals okay and here's the answer I hope you guys can appreciate this that on the far uh I guess left if you're coming in you have this animal and the one on the far or on the the sort of the middle there is his brother one has normal n one has low n and the one in low n a for most people that have seen this mice they are blind is indistinguishable from an old mice in fact looks even older than the 29-month old mice okay they have the furring of the hair uh the the the Browning of the hair okay sorry okay uh they have koses they have cataracts and they have several other features of Aging they increase fry and you guys can see what the fry scws are driven by they have osteoporosis and they obviously eventually die okay so do they have molecular features of aging and in fact if you look at Cellar syence and inflammation they do start to show some expression of markers of cellin essence okay and that happens in several tissues although it's not as overwhelming as I would have expected by this phenotype okay so we then look at the transcriptomic level and this actually to me is somebody that's not usually doing big data okay I'm more into the single protein single enzyme uh level there you can see see actually again on your far left the young animals they cluster very very very well together okay then you take the old mice they sort of cluster a little bit outside of that and then you have the low nag animals that start to Cluster even further but you even have old animals that cluster within the low n a they are almost the same in terms of of some transcriptomic analysis and we found there is actually 159 genes that change exactly the same between low NAD States and old age okay so it is possible okay and I know this is controversial and this is going to be kind of crazy but it is possible that there is a set of changes that happen with age that are actually driven by low NAD States and maybe it is the set of this9 genes maybe they have nothing to do with aging maybe they won't change anything uh but there is a signature in agent that appears to be an ad dependent so with that I'm going to sort of conclude uh you know the talk with you know obviously the concept can we then Target this uh and then as you guys all know Ned boosting therapy has been going on for a while um we had proposed this many years ago we have actually done the first actually Ned boosting experiments um we actually have shown that The city3 Knockout mice are resistant to high fat diet induced obesity this was long time ago and then H farma got actually really excited this was actually work done by uh Teresa burbol in my lab work done uh also already published in cell metabolism by Mariana tago showed that a drug developed by GS 78c that is a potent small molecule inhibitor of c38 can actually ameliorate several features of Aging in Old mice um so when we give this there's increase in health span they had improved in glucose homeostasis they run better their cardiac function was better um so they were in better shape we then asked the question whether they actually would live longer and so you know we did a very expensive experiment gave this uh drug for uh for the long long uh from the life of the animal and we saw that male mice when giving 78c actually leave it longer this is also published in agent cell we have then asked in several preclinical studies of different disease States so models of uh of ipf or chorma with bomy and and when treated with 78c or when you actually uh do that on The Knockout they do uh better muscle distrophy uh schema reperfusion okay okay there is another caveat about this uh enzyme obviously so this is an acto enzyme so you can approach not only with small molecules you can also approach with biologics okay so we have developed biologics with a company called tenal bio and if you from biofarma you probably heard about tal bio Teno bio did really well uh was acquired uh just about a year ago for a good amount of or a good chunk of money so we then tested the antibodies uh to see if they actually work in Vivo because what we wanted to actually demonstrate is not whether the antibody works or not but is to test the hypothesis is the ectoenzyme playing a role in NAD homeostasis in Vivo okay and so this is the model we use uh we induce uh cardiomyopathy with Dr rupin treated obviously the animals with the UN body and ask the question what happens and I'm going to spare you from the cardiac function you know obviously Dr Rubin decreased cardiac function giving the antibody prevented that uh but the thing that to me is remarkable is that although we are inhibiting an acto enzyme okay we could actually amarate mitochondrial function on those animals okay so this is the aorus tracing of animals with Dr ruping they're in Orange and when you give the antibody you bring them back to what they were before and the other thing is when you actually give a b68 the antibody even without any docks or rubs in around you see dramatic changes in metabolic signature so there is this metabolic reprogramming induced by inhibiting the Ecto enzymatic activity of cd38 okay um there is transcriptional changes uh and we saw that i7 and tnf were kind of the top ones so to conclude uh and I hope I wasn't too long um it's is it over 20 minutes I'm good all right okay well kick me out um so work done in my lab over the course of the last 20 something years has established cd38 as one of the key enzymes involving NAD metabolism okay uh we have shown that actually the process by which cd38 accumulates in cells in different situations Isa least in part link with sent cells and the sasp uh and we have and many others have now done several preclinical studies that sort of Link this Ned pathway disregulation and and changes in cd38 expression okay and as I told you we have approach this with small molecules or also with fun bodies um and then we think that one of the problems the Ned boosting may cause is that when you boost n you're boosting every single cell including senescent cells that actually want NAD okay so I think we need to reink the strategies uh to alter Ned levels and I'll give you a couple of caveats about cd38 there are problems with inhibiting cd38 this is a paper that we actually have uh published in cell report uh Jonathan was the first author of this paper if you inhibit cd38 there is an increased incidence of infections uh if you give a bacteria to the mice so this is one of the caveats uh and then you know there's many ideas that sound great uh when uh when you think about it and when you try it's a disaster um so I think that there's some note of caution and I'll tell you about just this one okay I always thought that was a no-brainer that giving an inhibitor cd38 with an Ned booster was going to be better than each one alone and as you guys can see over there it's actually worse and this is actually the most dramatic of all you actually have more inflammation when you actually give the CATE inhibitor plus NR okay then on the control animals we're just on a high fat diet okay so there's things that we just don't know yet okay so I would uh be very caution about proposing anything at this point I think we need way more studies [Music] uh
