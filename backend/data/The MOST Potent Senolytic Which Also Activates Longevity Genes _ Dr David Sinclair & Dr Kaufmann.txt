[Music] foreign is a flavonoid found in many fruits and vegetables physettin has many benefits here are three major ones first phys edin is a Ceno therapeutic that extends health and lifespan a study from the Lancet 10 flavonoids including Resveratrol quercetin curcumin tested according to the result visettin was the most potent analytic second fizzetin's role is an antioxidant phys edin works as an antioxidant by protecting cells from free radical damage it also exhibits anti-inflammatory Properties by turning off Pathways that promote inflammation and decreasing the production of inflammatory compounds third phys Ed and mimics calorie restriction promote autophagy and increases the levels of ampk insert one let's listen to what Dr Sandra Kaufman and Dr David Sinclair talk about phys edin yeah so ficotine is amazing feisa 10 is just it does incredibly like it's not a monster standout except for senescent cells but it just does incredibly well and like in every category you're gonna kill me I don't really remember all the specifics about it I can tell you it does help with your mitochondrial transition for it is a free radical scavenger it just does something amazing in in each category reduces fat collections for example but the senescent though is extremely important and just as a recoup of what senescent cells are just in case you know people don't know um some people call them zombie cells I call them grumpy old man cells and the reason I do that because you take a perfectly normal happy functioning cell and it undergoes DNA damage that's not uncommon because every cell every day has about 10 to the fourth the 10 to the fifth DNA errors per cell per day so it's a ton but the cell then goes into a state of quiescence where it just sort of sits there to repair itself and if it can great right and if it can't three things happen one it becomes apoptotic in dyes which I call like the polite way out right it's not no no harm no fuss boom you're dead fine or two it becomes cancerous which is not so good or three it becomes senescent and a senescent cell changes the morphology it becomes flatter more globular the inner organelles don't function as well the mitochondria become distorted everything sort of becomes distorted you get more protein accumulations and everything is named after sort of the cell so there's the senescence Associated blank like whatever it is now one of the big things it does it has a senescence Associated secretory activity and it lets out just a zillion negative cytokine so it's extraordinarily inflammatory and as you get older and as you have pathologic tissues you get more and more senescent cells your immune system when you are younger like the natural killer cells come along and they get rid of these senescent cells but as you have more senescent cells and as your immune system itself becomes senescent the number sort of skyrockets over the course of time and studies of demonstration that if you can get rid of your senescent cells you're just going to do extraordinarily better historically the big treatments have been quercetin and descendative of course it and of course is in book one and these studies were just coming out when I wrote it so it was an inkling but certainly nothing solid and as it turns out different senescent cells are different right if it's a fat cell versus a band cell versus a cell versus that cell and different agents can get rid of different types of senescent cells so it turns out that quercetin and phystatin are very similar in the cell types that they can get rid of which is kind of nice the big studies of course use the nasotub and the quercetin and they demonstrate that it's sort of like you need to have high quantities in your bloodstream for like two to three days and then you can you know go back to normal doses for you know a few months and as you get older of course you have more cells so you want to do a little bit more frequently but fisodin has proved to be just extremely good at getting rid of a certain cell type of senescent cells which is why you talk about the bolus therapy and then the intermittent therapy the daily smaller dose is just for the side effects of the mitochondrial health and and all the other wonderful things it does but the senescent cells definitely we need a high dose intermittently senescent cells are old cells that stop dividing and put out inflammatory molecules on cytokines and they've been shown in animals and some studies in humans but if you get rid of them kill them off the body recovers and heals and becomes more youthful and that includes treating metabolic disease and high blood sugar as well and Jim Kirkland who's at the Mayo Clinic is the world's expert in this and he's running human clinical trials so he's a friend of mine so we we we're up to speed on that and what he's shown is that the replied molecules and some drugs that work to kill those senescent cells and not so much normal cells because you don't want to touch the normal cells there are drugs there's nvida Clarks there's the satin there but the ones that are available to the regular consumer are quercetin which is again a plant polyphenol similar in shape to Resveratrol another one I call physique and it's also a plant molecule these two are shown to either prevent the senescent cells from secreting those inflammatory molecules that's called a cytomorphic or in the case of physique it's actually can kill those senescent cells and there's a group that University of Minnesota uh Laura niederhofer and Paul Robbins has shown that if you give visitin to mice they actually live longer by about 10 by my recollection but what's interesting about it it also works if you give it to the mice Midway through their lifespan to extend their lifespan and the other thing that's not very well known but as it goes back a number of years but in 2003 mylab published a nature paper that showed that Resveratrol activates or one but in that group was also of course sitting in phys Eden and so those three are that I take regularly not just to to work on sensor cells but they also activate uh so once you get this double potential double benefit but overall I I think this analytics are really interesting and can be really useful to prevent that type of Aging which is called caused by inflammation [Music] foreign
