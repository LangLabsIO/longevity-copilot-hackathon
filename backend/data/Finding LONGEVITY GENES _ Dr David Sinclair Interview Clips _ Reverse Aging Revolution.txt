[Music] uh so what about gene editing this is an area that is certainly controversial but no biologist talking about the future of humanity would be worth their weight in salt uh if they didn't raise it this is uh just a slide to remind me to say that we're looking at the effective uh genes and the ability to deliver genes in mammals and and now in humans to be able to correct but also augment what we were born with okay and i would unless i hopefully i won't forget to say so i'll say it now uh we are collaborating with george church on this so instead of altering the germ line which i think you all know is possible but frowned upon this is another way of doing it you can use viruses to deliver genes or you can just introduce rna which is not going to be a permanent effect and more and more we're learning how to do that as well and not use viruses but for now the fda allows us to use viruses typically they're used either in the bloodstream or in the eye to correct genetic diseases and there's a there's a flood of technologies are being developed in this area and many companies are working on this so this is an adeno-associated virus that we use in my lab to introduce viruses into an entire old mouse and see what happens but which genes would you want to use and so let me tell you a bit about that um so some of the genes that we work on in the lab come from other species we think that we're not perfect and some of the best genes are from other animals and so this is a tidy grade that will survive in outer space for a little bit in the vacuum of space so we've got the genome of that we're cloning with clone genes out of that organism and we've found genes that seem to protect mammalian cells dramatically against dna damage um vent cat v i won't pronounce his last name because it's way too long and difficult but venkat works at jpl so we're collaborating with jpl on their collection of thousands of extremophiles fungi and bacteria that survive in chernobyl out in space deep in the earth um and kyle landry is our expeditionary scientist who goes and finds these extra bugs he's about to go down a few miles into the earth's crust uh in the next few weeks and so together kyle and venkat in his lab are working on finding genes that can augment plants animals and humans one of the bugs we're working on and this in disclosure and transparency is being done at a company out in worcester massachusetts called liberty by security and this is a company that uh well this is a bug i should say that is able to survive hundreds up to a thousand fold more uv than a typical life form um and so there's a bacillus pumilo and it's found all over the spacecraft that come back from space and this is actually these are called coupons they put the the bacteria on on these metal strips and they expose them to outer space and look at how long they survive and venkat's team has published that these can survive out in space for over a year so they got something very special about them and we we're cloning genes out of that organism as well but humans have pretty good genes too and we don't all have the best varieties but some people do and so at least 25 percent of human longevity is genetic and these families that tend to live a long time these centenarian families we call them ten they have genes of gene variants that we're cloning out one of these sertuan genes that i mentioned is actually associated with longevity number cert six it's called and so we're looking at uh making mice actually if you put certain sticks into mice they live longer so that's a good news from a expo doc from my lab heim cohen um and so with all that knowledge we're hoping to be able to fix what we uh when we're not given by evolution [Music] [Music] you
