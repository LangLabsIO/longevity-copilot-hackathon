[Music] yeah it turns out i had banned canola oil a number of years when it was pointed out to me correctly that most commercially produced canola oil is canola is sprayed with glyphosate roundup and uh there is actually a lot to like about canola oil and there are now organic producers of canola oil what's to like about it well as i mentioned ala this short chain omega-3 fat was the subject of a very important heart disease study called the leone heart diet l-y-o-n from leon france most people know it as the lion heart diet because we don't pronounce it correctly so the the leon heart diet study took people with known coronary artery disease who had suffered a heart attack and they were divided into two groups it was a it was headed by a greek physician and they found one group had to have a mediterranean diet but they had to supplement their diet with a with a spread a margarine spread that was made out of canola oil ala the other group had to follow the low-fat american heart disease diet american heart association diet and the study was designed to run five years the study was stopped after three years because the group on the mediterranean diet with the canola oil had such better outcomes far less new events that than the low-fat american heart association diet that it was unethical to continue the study so it was stopped and here's the best part it turns out when they looked at all the factors in the diet that might have been contributing to this benefit you know maybe it's the fruits and vegetables maybe it's the olive oil maybe it's the red wine only the level of alpha linolenic acid ala in their blood correlated with the positive finding so you look at that you go wow that's pretty powerful and then you look at actual studies of what alpha linoleic acid does linolenic acid does and it actually uncouples mitochondria and reduces plaque and blood vessels so are there other sources for it yes flaxseed oil is a rich source of ala walnuts are actually a remarkably good source for ala but and also perilla oil gorilla oil is one of the fundamental oils used in korean and chinese cooking and perilla oil is a rich source of ala so lots of places to get [Music] you
