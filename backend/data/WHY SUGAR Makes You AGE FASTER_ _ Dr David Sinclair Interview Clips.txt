[Music] i've avoided sugar for at least 20 years and i'm i'm glad i did triple will do two things the main thing is that it bonds to your proteins and inactivates them and you get what are called advanced glycation end products you get glucoronidated proteins there's one that's in your blood that's an indicator of diabetes called hba1c your doctor can measure that it's a good indicator of diabetes but you don't want to get anywhere near diabetes a steady relatively low level of blood sugar is what we're aiming for for extra longevity and it's known that people who can control their blood sugar are healthier in the long run and probably have a slower aging clock so avoid foods that have what's called a high glycemic index spike you spike your blood sugar i've tested my own with with a blood monitor a glucose monitor so i know that foods like what just plain white rice of course desserts or a nightmare for the body generally i don't eat a lot of dessert and the other thing that sugar does is that it dampens your body's defenses against aging when there's a lot of nutrients around a lot of amino acids particularly uh leucine and searing and a lot of sugar your body doesn't defend itself it believes that there's no reason to defend itself and those defenses such that we've talked about the sirtuins mtor ampk shut down when there's too much energy around and so you don't want to get those spikes and thirdly if you go like this through the day with your blood sugar you'll feel totally overactive and you'll crash your body over compensates and your sugar goes down then you feel tired hungry and have a brain fog much better just eat smaller amounts and actually i prefer to eat very small amounts for breakfast and for lunch most of my calories at dinner so [Music]
