[Music] so actually i co-developed a blood test that predicts your biological age the best that we had until recently and vitamin d was one of five things we measured that correlated very nicely with longevity and so i'm a big fan i take vitamin d every day along with vitamin k2 for my blood vessels and i give it to my kids too because uh especially in a place like boston you can become deficient but i also i don't want to go anywhere near being deficient the vitamin d receptor is very important my wife who i mentioned earlier the scientists she studied vitamin d for the skin and the health benefits of activating these receptors and it's critical for for bone and for skin health you've got to keep those levels up but i've looked at the data and i've chosen to become [Music] mostly vegetarian and what i'm trying to do is to to not overload my body with excess protein you know we all need protein to live and make you know the amino acids are essential there's no doubt but overloading it by eating huge amounts of steak i think is a mistake uh and one of the reasons for that is there's a longevity mechanism in all of our cells that responds to how many amino acids we eat particularly the branched chain amino acids leucine isoleucine and valine and if we eat a lot of those what happens is this longevity mechanism in the body called mtor doesn't do its job it becomes lazy it says we got enough food let's not worry about surviving any longer we're going to put our effort into actually growing muscle rather than surviving and that's why it's good to for bodybuilders to bulk up on these amino acids because it puts the body in a state of growth but it's probably at the long term expense of health and longevity i i imagine there are a lot of studies that show that lowering the activity of this pathway is beneficial both in animals and in people um there are even drugs that are being developed right now to mimic low amounts of amino acids without actually having to just to actually avoid a lot of meat the the one downside of eating a lot of branched chain amino acids from meat uh which by studying animals it was a study from sydney australia was that these branched chain amino acids unfortunately stimulate the hunger response in your brain or at least in the animal's brain and so it actually caused those animals to eat too much and they became obese and died prematurely and so maybe what our friends are doing the carnivores by restricting their feeding is actually counteracting the negative effects of their high branch chain amino acid diet but that would be something that we'd need to to really study to say for sure [Music] you
