[Music] so having a big spike in nad in your body it might kick start the body there there's a an effect in the body called pseudo hypoxia and we discovered this happens when you get older your muscles think that they're stopped for oxygen but they're not really and we i think that having a big bolus of nad or hyperbaric oxygen therapy which is putting your body at greater oxygen and barometric pressure will kickstart the body and get you through that pseudohypoxia so your body's not fooled into thinking you don't have enough and when it does that by the way it shuts down the energy production in the body so that's a way possibly to rejuvenate the muscles of your body and potentially your brain as well um there are a lot of questions about whether or not you can take too much nad can your levels be too high in your body there's no evidence of that yet uh we've given mice a lot of n and men uh for years uh for years in their life at high doses haven't seen any negative effects in the human clinical trials we haven't gone more than two grams a day uh one in the morning one in the afternoon but no negative side effects there uh and looking at extensive blood by chemistry um health so i don't know of any yet um like anything you can always overdose in it you can overdose on water so you need to be very careful and and if you're going to try a supplement don't take the full amount in my view it's better to ramp it up and check your blood and work with your doctor to make sure you're not doing any damage to your body particularly the liver is susceptible to supplements so i monitor myself through a company that i work with called inside tracker but you can work with your doctor and just make sure that your body's healthy as you do something new like that um but you know if if there was a problem with nmn i would stop taking it and i certainly would alert my family and friends as well but i haven't seen anything yet [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] you
