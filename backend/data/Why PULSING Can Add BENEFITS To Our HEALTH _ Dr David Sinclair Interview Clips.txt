[Music] um so hormesis is uh you know i think it's a wonderful thing i like to call it what if it doesn't kill you makes you stronger and longer lived but that doesn't mean at all that we want to always be under this same condition and the more we learn from studies what we realize actually is that the body can even get used to hermesas all right you want to be changing things up in your daily life in probably in supplements and uh [Music] and it's no surprise to me that it gets confusing because we have this standard model and and a lot of books written about it that if something works you know to take it in the morning if you take it three times a day it'll work even better you know and that's not true when you take it how much you take uh in terms of the day and whether you're exercising whether you've eaten all of these things play in and it's extremely complicated and if anyone says they know the answer they are lying or or they're delusional because we don't know um at all really what the best combination of these supplements is inter and also combination with diet and time of day now i don't want uh listeners to think that we know nothing right we know a fair bit there's a whole 30 years of research on this even more but i think as a general theme what guides my research and also uh you know what i hesitate to call self-experimentation is the theory and the belief actually that that our bodies want to to be challenged and that's what wakes up the sirtuins the mpk the mtor the insulin igf-1 which is controlling mtor and because some of the experiments that that we do in the lab have seen that that i'll give you a good example um resveratrol right everyone dumb that down let's just drink lots of red wine and we'll live longer that's that's not true for a start you need to have a lot of resveratrol but the other thing that's missed even by scientists particularly those scientists who you know want to challenge my research is that they they miss the fact that we also published with with rougher to cabo down at nih that resveratrol given on a high fat diet will extend lifespan resveratrol given on a lean diet did not extend lifespan by the way the amount that got into the body of those lean animals was about five fold less of than what you get if you have a fatty meal but what did work that is almost always ignored or or intentionally or otherwise is that if we gave resveratrol to those lean mice every other day with their food okay so you're giving pulsing food and pulsing resveratrol out of all the mice out of all the groups those were the ones that lived the longest even longer than if you just gave resveratrol or intermittent fasting alone so what does that tell me is it it's very likely that it's not just what you eat it's when you eat and in certain combinations and so i'm in that i'm at that point actually where i'm trying to to discover things in my lab discover things with my own body to try and figure out when's the best time to take things metformin is is a good example there's one study that says people on metformin are likely to be protected from diseases of aging and then studies that come out which i think are really over-hyped in a negative way uh is that taking metformin will inhibit the benefits of exercise but but i was gonna i was gonna qualify because it's not it's not all exercise it's it's weightlifting but if you drill down into the data there actually that the all groups metformin or without gain muscle mass they were all just as strong but there was a slight difference in the size of the muscles okay fine if if all you care about is the size of your muscles don't take metformin if you want to be just as strong and potentially be protected against cancer heart disease for lte and of course diabetes then you know take a good look at metformin but does that mean that you should take metformin on the same day that you exercise maybe not and that's what i'm trying in my regimen [Applause] [Music] [Applause] you
