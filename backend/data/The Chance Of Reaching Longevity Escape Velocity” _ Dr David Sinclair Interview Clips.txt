so so [Music] and i'm wondering how big you think the chances are of reaching longevity escape velocity in 50 years and if you think it is possible in that time frame how the road map towards that would look like right so i in the beginning of of part three of my book i talk about what does the future look like let's do a little math and add up theoretically what could happen over the next 50 to 100 years uh so i'm i'm i wouldn't call myself an immortalist mainly because i'm so busy every day trying to just get get things practically done um but i do i do dream a bit in the book about what what i think will unfold over the coming years um what's what so i changed my view during the writing of the book and that's because there was a big discovery in my lab we've been able to reprogram uh a mouse's eye and save it from blindness to um treat glaucoma and actually dramatically reverse the the epigenetic clock the so-called horvath clock and restore youth until that data came in even with rapamycin and other molecules that we work on at foreign nmn that there was no way we were going to make it uh to 120 on average it's already extremely difficult to extend human average lifespan and maximum by just a couple of years but we're doing it slowly but but it's what we need is a quantum leap in uh in our understanding and abilities and that's what i think we've had and i've seen a lot in my career and wan cheng liu is the student who made the breakthrough in my lab collaborators include um jigang he and bruce cassandra here at harvard and uh that changed my view do i know if we're gonna hit escape velocity i can't say um and i i won't say but i do project um increasing lifespans and perhaps dramatic ones if we're able to get these new reprogramming therapies to work in people and i hope to start the first safety trial with that technology in about two years i'm working with juan carlos belmonte from the salk institute who's a probably will win a nobel prize for this um stephen horvath who developed the clock and myself and a fourth person uh manuel serrano who also works on this and discovered p16 this senescence inducing gene so that's the update hopefully that gives you enough background and entices you to read up about it more so [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] you
