[Music] we already know from horobat's work and others that certain lifestyles will accelerate the clock and others will reduce it and that's looking at thousands of people um so unless you're a total skeptic and you're just a glass half empty kind of person you've got to look at that data and say those and and by the way horvath's clock like grim age uh predict your longevity that way and um even how long you you're going to live from that point so you've got to look at that data and say okay the clock is valid you know it's got five percent error but still you've got to believe that it's measuring something related to your actual aging and your future help so i think we're already there i think that these clocks need bit more development we need them in more people but i have no doubt that we're going to be able to use these clocks to predict someone's future health and longevity it's already done in various studies which means that if you reverse the clock and in multiple clocks i don't just mean a blood test because your blood might improve but your brain might not we need a way to actually test multiple tissues it could be a cheek swab spit might be a muscle biopsy in some people just to test and also blood but at least you need to see it happening in multiple parts of the body to be more convinced this is true um but with that i i think that um at least if you're not skeptical in the next five years we'll have a number of interventions that are well established and well accepted to slow down um and if not reverse and also reverse aging including alpha ketoglutarate which looks promising synalytic molecules look promising for true age reversal that's different than saying oh the mainstream medical establishment and the fda agree that will take many more years and we know from the team study the metformin uh study that near rare's lives heading is that the while the fda is open to the idea of calling aging a disease they need to see that you can reduce markers that are agreed upon that represent age which includes frailty uh cognition um and some blood biomarkers as well and that's that's a lot of work it's very expensive so it's different i think acceptance within the our community is pretty much gonna happen in the next few years doctors will probably take maybe seven to ten years and then the fda could be even longer but i hope i'm wrong about that well yeah you know i i sound i sounded a little bit conservative there i think with the the pace that we're learning to educate people with the books with the podcast with uh just people talking about this there's a lot of buzz i hope that we can accelerate this but so far it's it's happening at a grassroots level rather than the top down well talking to my circle of advisors and friends uh there's been a paradigm shift in the way they think but of course my circle is not representative i haven't taken a survey that would be a good thing to tweet today to see what happens if you're a doctor what do you think um i have faced the opposite i faced criticism particularly from one doctor through direct messaging that uh nobody should be allowed to use a glucose monitor unless they have type 2 diabetes to which i replied and and then tweeted that would be like saying uh people shouldn't have a bathroom scales in their bathroom to monitor their body weight no who's to tell us what we can measure and what we cannot but hey you know where i sit on this but there there certainly are these really strict opponents even with calling aging a disease there's i had to just i'm going to be publishing in a landsat a letter saying uh please don't reverse the decision to call aging and disease at the world health organization because there are some vehemently opposed doctors that say aging should never be considered a disease um and i don't even know what it hurts i don't know why they're offended i think just people don't like change and this is an example of that [Music] you
