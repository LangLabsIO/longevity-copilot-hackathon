so so [Music] this is kind of something that comes to my mind i don't think it's often thought about this way at least in the field but you know because nad is required for cells that have a really high energetic demand like activated immune cells for example activated immune cells require a lot of atp for energy and a lot of nad um and if you think about like chronic inflammation how you know you're especially with as you get older and you're unhealthy and with age it get you know basically it is it is increasing if you're having more activated immune cells is there any way to test if like the nad like there's a triage where nad is kind of being sucked away to these activated immune cells and like then your mitochondria are now suffering and you get like mitochondrial decay because because you're you're sort of shunting all this nad it'll like take care of you know what your body thinks is potentially an infection that could kill you right so there's probably some sort of evolutionary mechanisms at play that say oh yeah immune cells need this nad more than mitochondria or something i don't know so it'd be kind of interesting do you follow what i'm saying oh absolutely i think you're you're probably right uh been thinking along the same lines that as you get older you're you're losing the ability to make an ad but you're also chewing it up and as it gets worse and worse um as you get older the immune system is a big drain on nad uh and actually so uh is dna repair right with the activation of parps and and once you drain nad a little bit then your perps and your immune system won't work but then they'll they'll need more nad uh because you'll get more damage and this is a positive feedback in in a bad ways that you once you start going down the nad decline the cells just start to need more and more and more with accumulating dna damage and that's what actually what happens in yeast cells going back to those little critters that we found that they became overwhelmed with damaged dna and the stratuans were overwhelmed they had to go over and repair that genomic instability the dna instability and one of the reasons old cells became sterile which is a hallmark of yeast aging is because the sirtuins are keeping the cells fertile back here but they're so distracted by all this other dna damage that's going on over here that they lose their identity and that's a theme that we've discovered is likely true in mammals as well that accumulations of dna damage distract the serotonins from their normal job of keeping a cell with the proper gene expression and cellular identity and we see the loss of cellular identity over time in mice at least and our what we're trying to do is to raise nad levels back up so that they can fix the dna damage but also get back to where they came from and make sure the cell doesn't lose its identity too much i didn't know certains played a role a direct role and i guess they're regulating so many genes that they're playing a role in dna repair and dna damage well they're one of the first proteins to get to a broken chromosome really yeah we we discovered that a while ago it was a um it was a cell paper in 1999 if anyone would like to look it up mills myself and guarantee published that sir cer2 goes to a broken dna end and then helps recruit other proteins really so like like like gamma h2ax so the first thing that happens is gamma h2x gets lit up on the break and then within seconds cert one brings in hdac1 helps remodel the dna and the chromatin so that it's ready for the repair proteins to come in and without cert one getting there these other repair proteins are very inefficient but they're distracted certains should actually be regulating genes elsewhere important to know i think right this is all part of my idea my hypothesis called the information theory of aging is that we're really losing the information regulation over time and all of these other things that occur uh such as telomere loss and mitochondrial loss and loss of proteostasis and he would call it loss of protein folding mechanisms this could be upstream of all of that that we ourselves lose their identity and don't turn on the right genes the way they did when we were young but the trick is how do you get everybody to go back and reset and that's what we've been working on [Music] [Applause] you [Music]
