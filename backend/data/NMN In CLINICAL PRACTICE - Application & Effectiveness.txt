[Music] NAD or nicotinemod at dinanine Don nucleotide is one of the most abundant and crucial coenzymes of every living cell in your body it's basically an essential helper molecule in the chemical reactions in your cells that turn food into energy and it Powers cellular processes that basically keep you alive it fills your cells that need to produce cellular energy which they use for hundreds of processes you don't even notice like repairing damaged cells fighting infections combating inflammation fueling brain function and even warding off the effects of Aging basically there's no biological process that doesn't need NAD and NAD is one of the keys to maintaining healthy mitochondrial functions for instance there was a study from Japan that showed a daily intake of 250 milligrams of nmn which is just two tablets a day and I tend to use even more especially as we get older um but even two tablets a day or 250 milligrams of nmn significantly raised NAD levels uh and and the levels sort of doubled after about four weeks and then sort of plateaued and there were no side effects another study from Japan showed that it improved Sleep Quality and enhanced physical function in older people and another study in December showed that it enhanced uh mitochondrial DNA replications nmn I started using 200 milligrams 250 milligrams a day on people and as a preventive that's probably where I end up but as people get older you know I I use four a day and I probably could even use more but I sort of started to and if people aren't having any effect then I go to four and actually interesting enough I've been using a higher dose 80 day for long covert a long a lot of people have been having a lot of fatigue headaches and long covert symptoms in general and and one of the supplements I've been using is actually nmn but I use a today I use a gram a day so and then I'll come down to 500 milligrams a day you know and I usually add some quercetin and some specialized pro-resolving mediators as well so that's sort of what I've been using but the NM the nmn seems to sort of um sort of shift people from this fatigue to just gives them a boost of energy but you you need for that acute type of thing you need probably eight not probably my experience has been eight a day but generally I would say if you want to get an effect for a day 500 milligrams is a fair dose 250 is what I use just as a preventive thing I tend not to use it as much on younger people in my practice because it's it's you know it's an expensive supplement so and I try to use sort of you know very targeted supplements so I tend not to use it as much in younger people unless what I'm seeing for instance is a lot of biohackers people coming in they're starting the anti-aging process at a younger age which is a relatively new thing so yeah when people ask about it I use it but I don't it's not in the first line of of treatments in in younger people for me I'm not saying you shouldn't and if if you prepare to spend the money that's probably a good idea but that's not where I've had a lot of experience with it foreign at that age you want a quick fix that's often harder although they they have really good results when they start exercising more and and changing their lifestyle but what's interesting with the nmn is they sort of get a fairly quick fix so someone in their 60s and 70s are usually 500 milligrams is the starting dose some people actually need six but I usually will start people on 500 milligrams a day and then sometimes we'll go up to 750 to six a day but yeah you need to give someone like that a good dose and it's actually pretty amazing within a month you most people will feel the effect [Music] foreign [Music]
