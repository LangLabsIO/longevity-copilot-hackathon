[Music] so collagen peptides are small bioactive peptides that are made from the hydrolysis of of collagen and obviously collagen is a protein that forms the structural Foundation of your skin and bones and tendons and other connective tissues that's the most abundant protein in your body and plays a very important role in providing the strength and elasticity within most of your body so in terms of why it's called hydrolized collagen peptides it's because during the process of hydrolysis is when collagen is broken down into peptides these sort of smaller molecules which are then more easily absorbed into the body and those peptides are very rich in uh amino acids so Proline hydroxyproline that kind of thing and all of those are essential for the structure of your hair joints bones Nails Etc the key benefits of consuming hydrolized collagen peptides is improved skin Health joint health bone health even hair and nails and D digestion that's another big one so collagen contains amino acids that help the gut lining so one one of one of the things that a lot of people don't know about is the digestive health benefits uh and then the final one I would say is muscle mass so collagen peptides are very good for supporting muscle growth and repair that's one of the main reasons I use it well I think the question was worded in a way that made me say collagen because it's such a a lowcost item that everyone can afford it and I know that everybody needs it I've never seen a single person over the age of 40 that has enough collagen so whilst it is powerful I chose it in my top three because everybody needs it and everybody can afford it so when using do not age collagen peptides people see improvements in things like joint health and skin wrinkles and things of that nature but I think it should also be noted that you're not going to feel the effects unless you take it every day over a period of time it's collagen a vital part of the structure of your body but it's it's not a magic powder so the dosage is 10 gram which is equal to one scoop and most people take it first thing in the morning mixed with water I'm actually just about to take mine now thank you [Music] n
