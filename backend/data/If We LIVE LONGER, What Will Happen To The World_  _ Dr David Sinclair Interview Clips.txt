[Music] i do think about this every day and and since i published the book um somebody said something that stuck in my mind which i want to repeat uh they said when you hear about the news for a cure for childhood leukemia the reaction isn't oh that's going to ruin the planet with all these kids staying alive so why do we have to say have that reaction when we're trying to keep middle aged and older people alive so that's one the second thing is i've put some numbers where my mouth was or my head was and published a nature aging article on the cost savings of extending life span by a year or 10 years in the us and this the the value to the economy over the 30 years after that discovery would be in the trillions of dollars um and i mean the numbers are actually 86 trillion for a year and 365 for 10 years now that's a lot of money that's currently wasted on what i call sick care not health care and that money can be put towards education developing new technologies to treat uh or prevent climate change um that's a lot of money and it really is all about the allocation of resources and money no humans can achieve anything and they can either be making widgets or repairing crashed cars or i don't know pumping oil out of the ground but if you have money to spend on other things you can put people to work on really productive things um rather than things that are just currently uh perhaps too expensive and if we save this money we can we can use that wisely in terms of population both a lot of people worry that we're going to be overpopulated and the numbers just don't pan out we're already in most of the world approaching levels of replacement and actually in the us and europe we're actually declining japan's already in that process and that's a disaster for the economy if we don't do something about it our kids and our grandkids are going to suffer badly economically if we don't do something to keep people productive for longer and that's what we're talking about here today so usually what i do when i'm talking about the future is is with people um guys like brian greene and lex friedman um [Music] george church who's in my department uh we talk and dream about the future together um and that's my main inspiration the rest is just what i dream up and when i'm lying in bed at night thinking about what the future should be like if it was a perfect world um speaking of a perfect world i got to chat with william shatner last night which was a real thrill for me because i as a kid i was inspired by that somewhat perfect world and i still feel like we are aiming to get there um and that that may be what drives me each day is that knowledge that humans can do better and i just wanna want us to get there as fast as possible [Music] you
