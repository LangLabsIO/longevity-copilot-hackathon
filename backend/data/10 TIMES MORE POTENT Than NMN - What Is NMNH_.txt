[Music] and the work that I will present today is mainly focused on NAD nicotinamide adanin dinucleotide NAD plus particularly which is a molecule that that most of you if not all will know from your textbooks mainly as a as a co-actor in energy metabolism as a Redux gol Factor U mainly in balance with nadh um but in in recent years probably the last two decades or so uh there's more and more evidence that NAD can more play a more pleotropic role um because NAD is also the the substrate for several families of enzymes including the barbs the poly ADP ribos polymerases the cerin and the CD c ADP ribos synthesis and these enzymes in turn are not regulating just one reaction but they are regulating many many different reactions in the cell um and therefore NAD as a as a substrate for these enzymes can play a very versatile role in managing cellular homeostasis and by now we we estimate that n participates in more than 500 entic reactions covering basically all the metabolic processes in the cell but we've started studying this a few years ago in collaboration with Lor Hooks and Patrick SC at M University Center also in the Netherlands and this is a study that was spearheaded by George Johnson's a pi in my in my group and um what we did is basically we took biopsies especially the team in mastri is actually the one doing the clinical studies took biopsies muscle biopsies from younger individuals so typically students um and from older adults who were between 65 and 80 years old and they were subsetted according to their physical activity levels so we had trained individuals I would really call them strong athletes I mean they they they take about 14,000 steps a day which is is amazing um we have a group that we decided to call normal older adults but they take still 10,000 steps a day so that's still for me at least uh in the type of job that I have is is still uh still a lot 10,000 um and we had group of older adults that were physically impaired so we really had evidence that there was some some impairment in their physical function they still take over 6,000 steps a day but they were functionally impaired so we were able to get the muscle biopsies even from the from the impaired Group which was a bit of a challenge because they already have impaired muscle function they still allowed us to take a muscle biopsy we took the muscle biopsies and we performed metabolomics on these muscle biopsies to identify by metabolic changes that can maybe explain the difference between younger individuals and older individuals and maybe also the the difference between trained older adults and and non-trained older adults and so this is the data that we that we got on on the left you see the volcano plot with all the metabolites annotated that are significantly changed between normal older adults versus young so um we see quite a few changes there they are also highlighted here in in the heat map where the red signal means it's high and the blue signal means it's low and the one that's stood out for us also because we are of course from an NAD background is this NAD molecule which is high or relatively high in the in the younger individuals and then very much so reduced in in older individuals um there are several others that are also very interesting related to the N pathway like kin acid um also of thalmic acid is an interesting one because it has to do with reactive oxygen species although it's also a little bit different than than than really reactive oxygen species so we're we're looking into several of these um changes um still today but the one that stands out like I mentioned is NAD which also seems to go down with h and indeed if you look at the individual values and you also again uh classify by physical activity level uh you can see that there's this stepwise approach where older adults have a lower uh General generally lower abundance of NAD in the muscle but this is relatively well preserved or maintained in athletic elderly and it's it's the lowest really in in older adults with an impaired muscle function suggesting but not causally demonstrating that physical activity will improve your and ad um levels that's of course I mean the causal demonstration of that fact is is something still to be uh established um so we do see in preclinical models mice C elegance and now also in a clinical model so in a clinical setting in humans we see that NAD goes down with ag and um the question is can we fix this can we fix this H related decline and nid and does that improve H related diseases um I mentioned nicotinic acid is one of them um but we have several precursors several n boosters by now that that that we can employ to improve or or restore NAD homeostasis so one stopan as an amino acid we always considered tryptophan one of the minor contributors to NAD uh biology uh the major ones are nicotinic acids nicotinamide which is also is both a precursor and a downstream product of the NAD consumers um nicotinamide riboside which is a a more recent addition to this portfolio and also nicotinamide mononucleotide which also is a is a relatively recent both of these molecules they they sort of exist or have been studied only for the past 10 years in preclinical models and only for the last let's say five years in in clinical models so we know that each of these molecules nicotinamide riboside nmn and several of the others in a few steps um so here we have nicotinamide riboside we have nicotinamide mononucleotide in a few steps they will be converted to NAD and Elevate the NAD levels intracellularly and so this is when uh a postdoc approach or he was a PhD student at the time and joined me our lab as a as a postdoc is Ruben Zapata Perez uh he now leads his own group and the University of Mia in Spain and he came with this procedure he's an enzymologist biochemist by training he came up with this procedure of using nadh as a molecule and then incubating that with a pyrro phosphatase from eoli generating nm& which is another NAD precursor and then he has this fancy purification technique I keep calling it just fancy purification just for the sake because I don't understand really what he's doing but he has this fancy purification technique that that allows him to isolate this this pure n&h and the question was can we use this nnhh as a precursor for NAD and so the difference is really this age so we knew nmn nicotinamide mononucleotide as a precursor for NAD that was we already knew it for about 10 years but now n&h is a new one new kid on the Block and can that one also increase NAD and so this was basically the first graph that he he showed me after going into the lab um exposing different cell types aml2 a liver cell Line This is a adapost tissue cell line again a liver cell line fibr blasts um neuroblastoma cell line and and hila cells he exposed each of these cells to either NN so I I would say the oldfashioned precursor uh as well as Anam H I don't know why we have this old abbreviation was a secret abbreviation at the time it is n&h uh so he exposed them to n&h and in each of these sell lines u i mean 10 years ago we were we thought this was spectacular like a doubling in NAD levels in a Cell now all of a sudden we had a tenfold increase of NAD in in each of these cell lines except maybe the HG G2 which are a bit less uh responsive but n&h is very potent very potent in inducing NAD levels in all these different cell so I won't go into all the details of of the study it has been published um but what Robben did is to look at the enzymology of these Pathways look at the different enzymes that are involved in uh converting nmn the classical precursor into NAD and comparing each of these steps between NN and enh and he found that the majority of the pathway is identical so there is still cd73 which is identical it's still the ent's uh uh doing the transport it's still the nmnats that that catalyze the last step of the of the synthesis uh but the difference is mainly here the difference for um enmen the classical one it's converted to nicotinamide riboside and then it's the nicotinamide riboside kinase that converted back to nmn intracellularly but for NR so or for nmn it's converted to NR which is then integrated or imported into the cell and then it's the adenosine cyas which actually catalyzes uh uh this following step so there is a difference uh at at the level of this uh phosphorilation step which seems to be uh um the main driver of this differential response between nmn and nmh um so the next question obviously was does it also work in Vivo so in cells of course that's very nice but does it also work in Vivo is NN a potent NAD precursor there so the study that we did is um actually a very simple study so we we only injected twice uh in the mouse and we compareed to NN 250 m milligram per kilogram per day which is on the lower side of of what people typically use for enen We compare that to ANH we inject uh intra peronally um and then 20 hours later we inject again and then four hours later we sacrifice the mice throughout the study at different time points after the first injection we we take blood samples from the tail vein um and then after 24 hours so four hours after the second injection we take all the tissues and and we follow up on on the biochemistry there so this is actually what we saw when we we did this time course experiment so the first injection uh takes place here at Time Zero uh and and one hour later we measure NAD in in the blood uh and we do see that nm& not only in in cells as I showed before but also inv Vivo in a mouse is much more potent than NN and here even after 4 hours and even after 20 hours so this blood sample was taken right before the second injection even after 20 hours we still see a high level of NAD in mice that are injected with nm& rather than nmn because that one goes back to the Baseline um and this is still still high after the second injection so what happens in the tissues uh same as with the cells especially in liver cells we see that MH is very potent so we see with NN there's an increase in NAD levels which again we were always very positive about so there is a doubling of NAD levels in the liver but with n&h it's much more potent it's a fortime increase in NAD levels and even in tissues that are notoriously more difficult for for improving or or elevating the NAD levels like gmia muscle uh also the brain which typically don't respond very well to nmn they do respond although not spectacularly but they do respond to n&h still the majority of of the NAD increase we we do observe in liver and kidney which are always the most responsive tissues for these kind of treatments at the same time also for instance still doing the mouse work the mouse studies to identify the mechanism by which NAD Improvement um uh also improves the clinical field um so that brings me to the conclusions of my talk um we do see that NAD declines in tissues across various organisms mice cgant but also humans we do see that this Associates with health status so people who maintain an active life tend to have higher NAD levels although again the causal relation will have to be established um we see that um what I call classical NAD precursors they're not so classical because they're only around for for just over 10 years but they have shown limited translatability to humans the clinical trials we do see some effect in one trial some and others but not very positive like the preclinical models which are massively positive um we do see that these reduced Ned precursors like n&h but we also we also identified together with a group in in Switzerland n RH which is very similar actually they may offer attractive opportunities um to improve NAD homeostasis but obviously there's more work to be done to um apply this in a clinical setting no clinical trials have been done with any of these molecules and they're very unstable also they will not pass the stomach um so there there there really needs to be a solution to for instance encapsulate the molecule to to be able to to use them um and I think with the data that we have for bar syndrome in this preclinical model in this fly model but also the trial that was done in mitochondrial myopathy for mital myopathy um I think boosting NAD levels could serve as a therapy at least for some uh inherited mital disorders [Music] n
