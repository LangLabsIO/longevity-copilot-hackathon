[Music] foreign we have a number of studies going on and we are just finishing a cross-sectional study with really deep phenotyping and three ethnicities in Singapore Chinese Malayan Indian uh and we'll just be analyzing that data soon we're also collaborating with the national Precision medicine team in Singapore where they have 10 000 genomes and we're integrating aging data with that including DNA methylation telomere data and a few other aging biomarkers and I think that'll that data should be out relatively soon hopefully and I can already say that there's going to be some interesting ethnic differences in biologic aging which will probably get me fired by the Singapore government and some as well as sex dependent differences in aging so I think we're learning a lot about aging in Singapore which is critical and then I mentioned the human intervention studies I'm we're hoping for next month on the first start of AKG study we chose AKG first because it's extreme well I am biased it's also extremely safe and so we we wanted to make sure there's no adverse outcomes we're hoping for rapamycin or some derivative thereof for the next study to start in a few months and the idea is to do 10 or 15 of these studies sequentially so we can as I said compare and contrast so we have a lot of collaborations ongoing there's a lot of drugs out there that might affect aging the drug age database last time I looked at 110 that are reported to do something in mice and the ones on the left are things that we work on and I really don't want to talk about them much today I'm going to show you just a tiny bit of AKG data because people are asking but we have a lot of focus on Alpha ketogurate and on Jim fibrizza which is a fibrate and then the other ones are things we've been testing in mice and everything in green is something we see some beneficial effect in my sun and so if you think of us as a validation arm in mice we have a pretty good record of of taking what other people have reported in the field and seen some kind of benefits so I think that's a good argument that the field is on the right track things that aren't working in our hands it doesn't mean they don't work we're not doing it at super high power under every condition imaginable I know I don't want to argue that but a lot of things are working so that's the good news I'm particularly interested in your lithium which seems to have pretty robust effects we've changed our approach in mice so we're not doing survival studies as much anymore and we're doing Frailty and biomarker studies in middle-aged mice and part of the reason for that is we want to be able to link the studies as closely as possible to what we're doing in humans so we can iterate back and forth more easily and I'm happy to talk to anybody about that and we're happy to collaborate if you have ideas you want us to test just a brief thing about AKG this started as a product called rejuvant and it's a collaboration with Ponce de Leon Health we showed a lot of mouse data I'm just showing one slide what was remarkable about our AKG studies was that it reduced Frailty pretty dramatically in animals the extended lifespan too but the effects on Frailty were much greater so we wanted to argue that this compressed morbidity uh and uh we reported last year a human study which was not placebo-controlled it's uh contains a lot of what we will not be doing in Singapore which is going to be a much more controlled study but we thought it was worth putting it out there and uh there were 42 participants uh nope as I said no controls people took it for seven months and we did methylation testing before and after and we saw about an eight-year difference in biologic age by this test now do I think Placebo influences biologic age on this testing yes so I would guess that something like seven or eight years is a combination of placebo effect and hopefully the intervention as well the one thing that made me really look at this data hard though was that we saw factors that determine the response to the rejuvenant product and there were two of them one is if you were chronologically old you responded well and the second was if your biologic age was higher than your chronologic age you responded very well if you already were biologically very young you had a very small response and I I want to throw this out there uh we need we're repeating this now in better studies but I want to throw this out there to say that we need to think about which interventions are going to work in which people and it may be that it there is some sort of fixed maximum that you can get to biologically using the current interventions and if that's the case the things that are people that are aging poorly May respond to your interventions the people that are already aging very well may have a very small response this is only one agent we may see something completely different with other interventions but I think people should look at this as they're doing their studies to see if this is a trend or not we have a full study uh going and it's done we're analyzing data and I we started this before we had that other data and and we decided uh I think the point here is that it's not easy to figure out how to do these aging studies uh we decided and for this study to do 45 to 65 year olds that are have no disease and this was done in U.S by a uh Indiana University and what we didn't realize uh we should have is that if you select people in that age range that have no disease they're biologically younger so they were starting out about four to four and a half years biologically younger than their chronologic age and so we selected exactly the group that probably is not going to respond particularly well to AKG so we do see some responses whether we beat Placebo is still something we're trying to figure out um but I think that now as we go forward in Singapore we're going to start studies with people as an inclusion criteria not disease but people that are biologically older than their chronologic age when they enter the study and we'll see how that goes are there positives and negatives to that approach [Music]
