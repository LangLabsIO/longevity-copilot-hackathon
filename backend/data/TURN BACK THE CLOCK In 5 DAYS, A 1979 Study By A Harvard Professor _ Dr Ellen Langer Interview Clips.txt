[Music] the study is derived from a theory of mind body unity and let me just briefly explain this to me mind body these were just words and i said let's put them back together and if we do that wherever we put the mind we're necessarily putting the mind of the body so what we did was in the first study was put the mind back in time and then take measurements from the body we took a retreat that we had retrofitted to 20 years earlier and had men in their 80s and 90s living there for the course of a week as if they were their younger selves they watched programs movies from the past yet discuss them as if they had just happened everything about it was reminiscent of the past and we took lots of measures before we did this and then measures at the end and it was amazing to see the changes that occurred um the remember this is only a period of five days uh their hearing improved you know which i had never heard of an older person even younger people's hearing improving their vision improved their mental acuity approved and um in addition to other things the photographs we took of them before and then after we showed them to people who didn't know anything about the study and we asked them how old they thought the person was and those in this experimental group looked noticeably younger at the end truth be told they didn't live 20 years younger but still and this was the first of many many studies that we can talk about if you're interested but the the key to what's going on here is that we all have far more control over our health and well-being than most of us i realize but you know think about it it was a tremendous effort i mean you know first of all this was before google so when you want and we did this in 1979 so we were trying to replicate 1959 now all you do is you ask google tell me about 1959 we couldn't do it then it was a massive effort for us so of course i believed it would work or else i probably wouldn't have done it we had an earlier study with a nursing home where we went into a nursing home and we gave people choices to make just that simple um about when they wanted to see a movie we gave them a plant to take care of where they wanted to visit with friends and that very simple simple sorts of choices when we went back to the nursing home 18 months later half as many in this group had died as in the comparison groups that really helped usher in mind-body medicine so i already had evidence that the way we think about ourselves the world the way we engage it has very um big consequences for us you know so i had my graduate student postdocs working with me again this was before uh people fought for uh women's rights or holy fort but you know and the reason i say that is that i found myself on the bus going to the retreat with um seven old men and seven suitcases and uh i didn't realize it you know i didn't have any of my male students with me and when we got to the retreat right from the beginning i said to them that they're responsible for their old suitcases now these are people who barely you know could walk i mean they were able to walk but they they really seemed old when they came to see if they could be in the study their um adult child usually a daughter came with them answered most of the questions for them and so on so by by all impressions they were old here by saying to them you're responsible for your suitcase i don't care if you move it an inch at a time to get it to your room or if you unpack it here well i mean that was so vastly different from what they were used to and that was for the comparison group then this comparison group was not going to put themselves back in time they were simply going to reminisce for the week but because of that push forward um they also showed big changes and improvements in the course of the week just not as many as the experimental group you know there's a tendency to try for older people to make life easy you make it too easy there's no opportunity for challenges for feelings of mastery you know so i used to argue nobody listened to me but that if if we went into nursing homes and we made them a little harder that it would actually be doing a favor for people you know uh i was doing this television show and i had suggested to them this is 40 years ago that they might want to open like this they didn't and i suggested this to many people since nobody did but it was you have a in the camera and you're asking a person wouldn't it be wonderful to have every need met to have somebody taking care of everything you wanted in life and preparing you know and then the camera goes to a nursing home you know for people to realize no that's not really what i want um the struggle that we argue against um you know is really part of the the essence of life [Music] you
