[Laughter] [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] the 19. now one of the areas that we work on of course are the sirtuins these are enzymes that our bodies make there are seven of them in most of our cells and they're very important for fighting against diseases both chronic diabetes heart disease alzheimer's we believe based on a lot of mouse and human uh genetic studies but they also we're finding are important for viral defenses and we put forward a hypothesis in this paper that the sort of defenses are are lost during covenant infections and one of the reasons for that is the following so sirtuins need nad and unfortunately as we get older we think that a lot of our cells lose the ability to make nad effectively and they also destroy it for reasons that we don't fully understand yet but what we've also discovered in my lab and in others charlie brenner i put out a nice paper about this that the virus coronavirus and other types of viruses deplete nad and cells and we think this is part of their their defense the viral attack and the inability of cells to survive the attack now they do this through activation of the parts parps are poly adp ribosome trans uh polymerases so they do this by activating the parts such as part 1 part 12 part 14 and parts are enzymes that polymerize nad and deplete it from the cell and we think that by either blocking the power of activity or replacing replenishing the nad levels in infected cells and in the body of patients we can give them a better chance of survival now why would we worry about nad and sirtuins well sirtuins particularly sir two and six or two and one and so two and two they control inflammation and they dampen it when it's overactive i mentioned the inflammasome while one of the key components of the inflammasome is called nlrp3 and the acetylation chemical addition to that protein is what causes it uh to be active and actually if we deacetylate of enzymes like cert one insert two deacetylate in lrp3 it brings that activity down and so what we're thinking is that when cells are infected the nad levels go down sirtuins are unable to dampen the inflammatory response and you get this cytokine storm so in other words if we were to raise nad levels in patients we may be able to prevent their bodies from going into this state of shock and a septic like response now i will admit at first i didn't think this was something that i should rush into of course i would look like somebody with a hammer looking for a nail because you'd think that everything that i do looks like an nad problem but studies like the paper that came out as well as studies over the last five years in my lab that have looked at nad changes during macrophage activation and the pop response have really pushed me into the belief that as i write in this article with my co-authors that nad is part of this story now it's not the whole story in fact the nad story in this paper is only a small part of it about five percent but i want to talk about it because a lot of people are asking me david what about nad and interestingly i've been working with the team in boston on making an nad precursor a drug and so for the last two years with the help of a great team at brigham and women's hospital they've been testing the safety and efficacy of an nad precursor called mib 626 which is a proprietary version of an nad booster is that so far the molecule is extremely safe in the people that have been tested it's able to greatly raise nad levels [Music] [Music] [Music] you
