[Music] what our data shows is beta hydroxybutyrate so this is the major ketone body there are there are three there are two others acetoacetate and acetone but the major one which is present in millimolar concentrations in your blood when you fast has is not only has two different properties one it is a nutrient that is it's a form of energy think about it something in between a carbohydrate and a lipid but it also has signaling properties and this is what i alluded to so the signaling properties of of of metabolites it's clearly in the case of by inhibiting the age dark it modifies the epigenetic landscape and so there are multiple ways in which you can enter a state of ketosis one way is to fast so if you you know go on a water only diet within 16 to 18 hours you will see ketone bodies appearing in the blood you can recognize this in someone's birth the breath becomes fruity because of the acetone that you excrete as a gas but so obviously you know if you go on a prolonged fast and you go you know people have shown you know on a 10-day fast you can have beta-hydroxybutyrate level go up to 10-15 millimolar extremely high obviously that's not something that you want to do every day so people have looked for alternative matters in which to induce ketosis and there is a way to do this without fasting which is simply by a carbohydrate restriction and so if you cut down your carbohydrate by less than two less than about 15 grams per day which would be the equivalent of an apple a day over time you will enter ketosis now there's a third way and so you know we have all kinds of ketogenic diets that are available the one that many of you are probably are familiar with was was the atkins diet which started in the 70s and got a bad name and a bad reputation because it was argued that people should stop eating carbohydrate and replace this by greasy meat essentially which i'm not sure is totally healthy but there are there are other ways to enter ketosis and and to conduct a ketogenic diet without eating highly saturated fats and there are lots of books and advice on this and i i think i i go for it periodically on this type of diet and i find it is it is a diet that feels extremely healthy in terms of in terms of brain function now the third way to go to into ketosis is by eating or absorbing directly beta-hydroxybutyrate itself and there are a number of product that you can buy right now better hydroxybutyrate salt there are all kinds of problems with those one is beta-hysteria is a very short-lived metabolite so if you eat you know if you eat it at t0 within an hour an hour and a half it will be gone the second is it has to be absorbed as a salt and and which means that either you know people have an excess of magnesium so you can see citrate or sodium and so that this brings a number of problems so if you've seen uh hydroxybutyrate salts on amazon i would argue that this is probably not a very healthy way to enter ketosis and so to address this we we've generated a novel ketone body esters that actually are commercially available now i don't know if it's appropriate for me to plug in a product that i've that i have developed but there's a product online called metabolic switch this is a product that we this is a molecule that i designed a number of years ago actually five years ago and what it is it is a hybrid an ester between beta hydroxybutyrate and a fatty acid and so what this does is allows you to eliminate the salt problem this this ester is absorbed and it gets slowly hydrolyzed which releases beta-hydroxybutyrate which raises your ketosis immediately so if you take the recommended dose within 30 minutes you will be at about one millimolar like ketosis and on the other hand the short fatty acid that we have linked goes to the liver where it can be used to to generate de novo beta hydroxybutyrate so you have a little bit of a delayed effect and when you take a dose of this beta hydroxybutyrate ester you actually you will enter ketosis and you will remain there for 46 hours and so you know we we've seen you know the i mean we have documented the product is sold it actually does work and it's an interesting experience experiment to conduct if you've never felt what ketosis is if you have fastid for three days people describe that after three days you have a clarity first you lose your hunger and you have this feeling of deep clarity and this is recapitulated simply by absorbing the ester so we're quite excited by the product there's a significant barrier to this product which is its taste which is horrible and i found personally that if you if you if you like kombucha a glass of ginger kombucha right after erases the taste so it actually allows one to deal with with this issue you don't need to adjust your diet that's that's the the beauty of it so you can be in a ketosis and eat anything you want yeah and and you know frankly one of the things that one of the the effects that we've seen this is still early the product went on the market about six months ago is a loss of appetite so i'm not sure that this is something i would recommend to someone who is you know fully healthy and exercising and doing everything they do but we've seen a really dramatic effect in obesity so people losing weight and frankly the ketogenic diet has been used as a as a very efficient tool for people to lose weight and we've never really understood why it was working so well this is one of the reasons for the popularity of the diet today but we i i've experienced it myself if i take a metabolic switch my appetite goes away completely it's actually very strange and so we'll see we'll see you know the one thing that i should say also i was hesitant at first to sell this as a supplement because i i've really you know as a physician i i believe in you know an evidence-based type of product but we are currently we will be conducting clinical trials for specific indications because we think we know there might be a group of patients for example obese individuals or someone with type 2 diabetes who might be interested in taking this chronically today even without a clinical trial i want to demonstrate the efficacy and so we're looking at a number of potential indications where these compounds could be tested using the you know the standard tools of a clinical trial to determine whether there actually are efficacious simply based on anecdotal evidence we know they're safe they we went through a an approval process with the government for so-called grass approval so we know the products are safe now we want to demonstrate their efficacy and i think these studies are ongoing i think in the case of these esters we've we have tested them in a number of models for alzheimer's disease in mice and we have a paper that is in preparation with john newman i should say a lot of a lot of the work on the ketone body has been done with another collaboration between john newman's lab here at the park in my laboratory [Music] you
