[Music] a lot of you know nad's been a popular thing within the scientific field for quite a while now and but the science is really changing in terms of what we understand about NAD production and also decline in the body and one of the major things that's changed is our understanding of first of all how our body produces energy and and why it's depleted and it's been found that the major way that our body actually makes NAD is actually by recycling it so it has a pathway called the Salvage pathway in most cells where when NAD is actually used by the body so when it's used by enzymes and Pathways and it actually gets broken down into some of its fundamental components which are called precursors and the main precursor which NAD gets broken down into is something called nicotinamide now in young cells they have this amazing capacity to be able to recycle that breakdown product that nicotinamide straight back into useful NAD again and this is called the Salvage pathway and the majority of our NAD is actually made in this way when we're young and if you think about it it makes complete sense because NAD is so critical for the body why would the body want to rely on having to have some sort of external nutrient to make this NAD it needs to have almost a Fail-Safe mechanism to be able to continually Supply the cell with NAD no matter how much it's using so when we're young NADA is used up it's broken down into nicotinamide and the Salvage pathway literally salvages it and recycles it straight back into fresh NAD that can be then used again for all the repair the maintenance the mitochondrial function and and keeps getting recycled now the issue is is that it's been found that our NAD levels mainly decline because this becomes dysregulated with age and the Salvage pathway in older cells simply doesn't work as well and the reason is is because the main rate limit rate limiting enzyme in this pathway an enzyme called nampt actually declines with age so if you take a sample of of someone cells who is older and you will find that they simply do not have as much of this nampt enzyme so what that means is in older cells where they're using up the NAD and breaking it down into their waste product nicotinamide it's just not getting recycled so cells are using it and using it but it's not getting replenished like it should be and and that's a really important thing to bear in mind and when you're looking at you know restoring NAD levels or trying to impact NAD in any way you know what Ibis um our research on is what it what the latest science actually is and what it shows of why nad's declining and what the root causes are and so in terms of boosting NAD levels there are a few ways that people have probably heard of um one way uh which I definitely don't recommend is taking pure NAD in capsules and and that is because NAD is a very unstable molecule and so if it's just a pure you know NAD Plus or nadh or whatever in a capsule and there is no way that it will go through your gut and survive and get anywhere in the form that it's needed so that's a definite No-No um the way that people have tried to get around this is by um supplementing with what we call precursors so these are the building blocks and that that the cell uses to make NAD uh the common ones that people will know are the B vitamins like niacin niacinamide nectinomide and and then you've got um NR which is nicotinamide riboside and then you've got nmn which is nicotinamide mononucleotide and the majority showed if people seem um you know have heard of of these types of ways to boost NAD now the way they work is they are just building blocks that the cell basically uses um to make NAD and the issue with this taken these is um whilst they do Boost NAD by around 40 to 60 percent that's in the published clinical studies and they're absolutely ignoring the reasons why nads decline in so um I always get people to think of this as a bit of a factory scenario so if you think of yourselves as a factory that's producing NAD because that's essentially um what they are and and production goes down in that factory and how do you try to boost production again would you just say oh production's gone down so we'll just order more raw material and hope that it gets converted into it gets made into NAD when actually if you took a closer look what you realized is that the reason production's down is because the machines are broken because there's no staff because the pipes are leaking would you still think that it's a good idea just to order more more raw material and and hope for the best no probably not you'd probably say well we could do a lot better job if we uh you know employed more staff if we fixed the machines and we plug the leaking pipes and so this is where we say the best way to actually boost NAD levels is to have a whole system approach and really look at the root causes of NAD and what's going wrong and the main root causes of NAD is because the Salvage pathway isn't working as well so what can you do to actually boost your Salvage Pathway to increase levels of that nampt enzyme so that when there are precursors in in the cell when there is NAD in the cell it can actually keep getting used and recycled rather than just um you know taking in more precursor and it's not actually getting converted to NAD in the first place the other thing is you know look at the processes that are wasting NAD because the other reason that NAD declines is because when we get older you get a huge uh change in the cells in the way that they use an NAD one of the key ones is chronic low-level inflammation and that is something that we know people suffer with as they get older having this low level low-grade inflammation and that's known to cause the overexpression of something called cd38 um in our cells and basically cd38 is an enzyme that just drains NAD it just sucks it out of the cells unnecessarily and and so just by inhibiting cd38 just a little bit you can actually boost NAD levels so again this is like looking at what the root causes are in the cell that are causing this Decline and then actually fix them and you can use that and there's studies to show and in cells in vitro that if you inhibit cd38 even just by a very small amount with epigenin you can actually boost NAD Levels by 50 so this is just as good as using a precursor so can you imagine what happens if you take a whole system approach and you actually you know you have a precursor so you've got some of that raw material available and you inhibit these wasteful processes and you activate any MPT you basically fixing all the issues and you're restoring the cell's ability to be able to make and use and recycle its own NAD again like it did when it was younger and and I guess that's exactly the approach we've taken and when we we've took this approach with our product we find that it boosts NAD a lot better than just using a precursor so in in terms of numbers in our pilot study it boosted NAD by 242 percent over 16 days which is a lot better than 40 to 60 so before I um founded nachito I actually worked in drug development um and my before that my PhD was actually in um the bioavailability in pharmacokinetics of drugs and nutrients and so that's something I'm incredibly passionate about is actually understanding you know how much of something has to go into an oral formulation to be able to go through the gut and the liver Etc and actually end up in the cells at a concentration that will actually have some efficacy within the cells and so when formulating our product that was a huge amount of work to to get the right levels of the ingredients and also the right combination of the ingredients because within our product unlike nmn or NR it's not just one ingredient it's not just a simple precursor it's um it's got a precursor in there we use we actually use nicotinamide which is one of the Beaver and the reason we use that is because nicotinamide freely diffuses three cell membranes it doesn't rely on a transporter to get it through unlike NR and nnmn which can't actually access all cells in the body and the other ingredients in there they've all been selected based on the most bioavailable forms so um we met we mentioned apigenin um earlier epigenin if you took that in its pure um you know chemically synthesized form shall we say the the bioavailability is is actually very poor however if you take it in a format and that's a bit more natural such as parsley powder and which is what we actually include in our products and it's readily absorbed by the body and then the the epigenin is actually released and once it's been absorbed and then it's actually in a more useful form in the body so that's why we see that it does indeed get into the cells intact in in the way that we need it to do that ala does a multitude of different things the reason it's in our product is it's an activator of the mpk and is incredibly important for activating the Salvage pathway and the the other thing that alpha lipoic acid does is it activates um another enzyme called nq01 and basically what this does is it um it flips NAD between its two states so NAD can either exist as NAD plus which is the oxidized form or nadh which is the reduced form and what we find is that if you activate nq01 it it pushes the ratio of NAD plus to nadh towards NAD plus and which is the more favorable Direction and whereas as you get older it tends to drift towards nadh which is not a favorable ratio and so ala also works within within this capacity as well to improve any D levels Sephora Japonica this is one of the ingredients that we have in our formulation and the dried flowers of the Sephora Japonica tree contain the powerful flavonoids quasetin rooting and trucks routine now these flavonoids were selected for our formulation based on their ability to increase levels of the nampt enzyme so remember this is the enzyme that is absolutely critical or rate limiting for the recycling of nicotinamide back into fresh NAD but it actually declines with age meaning nicotinamide can't be recycled the nicotinamide builds up you get methyl donor depletion so this group of flavonoids actually increase nampt enzyme levels and therefore improve NAD Recycling and production now as well as that NAD boosting capabilities there's also robust scientific evidence to show that these flavonides also have a like a whole host of other range of Health promoting benefits including antioxidant effects anti-inflammatory effects and also highly topical right now antiviral properties so additionally we've also got cassettin in there which falls under the category of substances known as xenolytic some of you will be familiar with cnlx but these compounds clear senescent cells from the body so finally as well as all the ingredients that I've already mentioned and we also have some of the supportive ingredients in our formulation and just to enhance the health benefits so the first one to mention is black pepper extract and the reason we put this in is because it contains the active molecule piperine so piperine is actually used to help increase the uptake of nutrients from the small intestine because it allows um various active molecules as well as the ones we include in many of the ones that we've got in our formulation to enter the blood and access the rest of the body and get to the cells more easily so this is basically added to Nigeria time plus to improve absorption of the active ingredients and piperine is also known to be beneficial because it actually boosts metabolism by activating thermogenesis and which is a process that bakes down fat cells so that's an added bonus then we've got good old vitamin C here and so we also add vitamin C because as well as have a reputation of being able to fight infections its health benefits actually start far beyond immunity so people who actually take regular doses of Vitamin C have been found to live longer than people that don't and this is likely due to the fact that it reduces inflammation it protects the Integrity of DNA and it reduces biomarkers of cellular stress and finally we've got zinc so as we age there is a progressive decline in our immune response and you know that is so relevant right now to the world that we're living in and supplementation with zinc has been helped to found reduce this impairment of the immune system so that is why it is included in uh formulation thank you
