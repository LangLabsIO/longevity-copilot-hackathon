so [Music] what are some of the easy things that we can do to slow down aging yeah well the the ancients knew this we just forgot it or we became lazy if there's one thing i could say that would very likely give you uh more years of healthy life and it's important these are healthy years where you look and feel younger you're not just living longer as an old person that thing would be uh to eat less often and and there's been some wonderful studies showing that mostly in animals but some some human studies as well that it's not as important what you eat it's when you eat and so i've skipped breakfast for most of my life i now skip lunch most days and have a regular dinner and that i believe is it's the biggest bang for the buck in terms of healthy longevity so do you do this 16 hour what i call intermittent fasting or do you do even longer than that i eat once a day and usually it's a healthy dinner if i can help it but i'm only human i think everybody needs to enjoy life so i have the occasional cheesecake kind of thing but not often uh and so it's i go for about 18 hours i try not to eat late as well because i don't sleep well so you do you have one meal a day seven days a week right okay if i have lunch maybe it's it's some nuts or a little salad but nothing heavy and that's rare and did you have to train yourselves to do see i i don't ever even want breakfast with me skipping breakfast is easy but my sister my husband just they have to eat the minute they wake up so for some people like you and i that's kind of natural but what would you say to someone who says skip breakfast and wake up rather nurse and and i really need lunch how do they do that well that's fine we're all different there's no one-size-fits-all for what i'm saying today or what i do so some people need breakfast they are hungry in the morning you and i are not but i think if if you can skip either the beginning meal or the uh the end of the day meal the dinner that would give you combined with sleep this 18 hours 16 to 18 hours that we think is going to be very beneficial and when you do it you said you eat anything so would you eat just whatever you wanted or you still look at some foods like high fat fat fried foods and salty foods like oh that's not great for aging either do you have some foods that you simply do your best to avoid because of their impact on aging oh sure and every meal i look at scientifically i'm just saying i don't always stick to eating leafy greens for dinner i'm not i'm not a rabbit but my diet does tend to look more like a rabbits than than a lions and there's a study that just came out a few days ago by steve horvath's lab um over in ucla he was one of the co-authors that showed that when you do that test of biological age that i was talking about the mouth swab that we're developing those kind of diets which are rich in plants legumes nuts low fat low sugar they do actually those people have slower aging okay have you got any um tips on the worst food that you should avoid if you possibly can because a lot of people say you know i i cut my appetite by drinking loads of diet coke i have so many models to say and i drink 20 cans of diet coke a day and i don't eat but then i think that's so bad for you because you're drinking like chemicals what would you say to someone who said i'm really not eating because i'm drinking diet seven up or diet coke or i think it's called mountain dew or lots of black sweetener in it right so i've looked looked into this and these diet sodas are are nowhere near as bad as actual sugar yeah well that's good to know you know high fructose corn syrup you just want to avoid that and certainly in america it's it's in a lot of foods i know uh but you know diet sodas aren't perfect they they trick the body and the microbiome into responding as though you're actually eating sugar but i really don't believe based on what i've read that they are that bad you know if you want to put a number on it just to to be you know more informative they might be ten to twenty percent as bad as real sugar and if you need a sugar fix uh absolutely need one you know it's much better choice than actual sugar uh but the best choice are some of these natural sweeteners stevia based sweeteners are what i try to try to eat um but you know one one candy one cake's not going to kill you um that's the point but try to be good as much as you can every day and over a lifetime or certainly that the latter half of live feed will make a huge difference [Music] [Applause] [Music] you
