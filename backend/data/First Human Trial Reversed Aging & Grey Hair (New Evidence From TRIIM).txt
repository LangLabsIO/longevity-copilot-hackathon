[Music] in September 2019 a small clinical studies results were published in aging cells it is the first human trial to show it might be possible to reverse human biological age originally the drug trial wasn't aimed at turning back the biological clock but rather it reversing a different sign of Aging shrinking of the thymus the thymus was successfully reversed but also the drugs had the unexpected results of reversing biological age by 2.5 years and even bringing color back to gray hair in some participants the authors of the study included Dr Greg Fahey and Dr Steve Horvath let's hear what the two authors have to say about the trial and the new evidence that they found [Music] of years ago Greg Fahey published a human clinical trial a phase one study which was a bit controversial among the Aging researchers and why because he had developed a cocktail of human growth hormone metformin and DHEA and vitamin D and administered it to these individuals and observed epigenetic rejuvenation when I first ran the statistical analysis on my computer I was really blown away I couldn't believe my eyes this cocktail even seems to reverse aging there was one gentleman whose hair was entirely Gray and after the treatment it was darker again there was repigmentation if we are really lucky maybe this treatment this cocktail really has a holistic effect that affects many organs of your body but first this treatment has to be carefully evaluated and replicated [Music] thank you we started the trim trial at Stanford University most of you know about this we're not going to spend a lot of time on this but the objective was to regrow the thymus using a combination of growth hormone DHEA and Metformin this was done on nine healthy men who were treated four times a week in order to stimulate regrowth of the thymus and we published the results in aging cell and uh it's available online some of the things we did not expect to see were hair darkening in uh three out of the nine Volunteers in the study uh we were only able to document it in this one case uh but two other people reported this to us uh and an improvement and apparent Improvement in kidney function at least the kidney filtration rate estimated GFR going up statistically significantly by nine and twelve months and uh and then continuing on uh apparently perhaps after the treatment ended at 365 days and the other results of the trial which caught a lot of attention happened to to be aging clock results uh Steve Horvath did these results for us uh so I believe them um uh he started off looking at the DNA methylation for a bath clock and to his surprise it seemed to indicate that aging was going in reverse uh and so he double checked this using the Levine clock the hantum clock and the Grim age clock and they all showed basically the same Trends although the details were slightly different if you look at the average of all of these clocks uh you see after about nine months we went back about a year and after uh 12 months we went back about two and a half years uh and that effect uh persisted somewhat uh even at 18 months and so to put that in context with normal aging you normally you get a year biologically older uh if you could achieve something called Longevity escape velocity you'd maintain your biological age for that one year of time uh and we actually reversed the Aging that took place during the winter of the trial and then went back another one and a half years so this was something novel and something interesting and intriguing which of course we'd like to know more about but here's some new evidence that you haven't seen before so uh Steve Horvath decided to go back and retro retrospectively look at the trim data uh uh using a different measure of uh aging uh so we looked at the pheno age clock epigenetic aging clock before but that requires that you take DNA samples and that you measure methylation sites and and that you wait until the end of the trial and so you don't get results during the trial itself but there is a component to the pheno age clock which relies only on testing things that are available in plasma or blood some of the white cell populations are red cell populations in the blood and so Steve went back and recalculated uh this plasma aspect of pheno age uh for guys in the trim trial and found that on average uh just as we found with the epigenetic clocks time going back by two and a half years in the pheno age plasma clock kind went back by two and a half years as well and uh one of the things that I haven't mentioned before is that the you know we've we've presented our mean results but of course some people do better than the means so the best epigenetic aging reversals were up to four to uh two to ten years and the best plasma Fino wage reversals were up to 9 to 11 years it's my dream that people get an annual measurement of their methylation and then the doctor would say you know what you age a little bit too fast why don't you take this anti-aging treatment I am quite convinced that people live till 150 the question is only when [Music]
