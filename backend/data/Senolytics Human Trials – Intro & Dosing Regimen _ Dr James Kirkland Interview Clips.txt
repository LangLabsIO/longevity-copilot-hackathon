[Music] uh the satnav is an agent um that's been on the market since uh has been on the formulary that physicians could prescribe in the us since uh 2006 so there it's been around for a long time as a formulary drug it's used to treat uh lymphomas and leukemias and it acts in lymphomas and leukemias that are producing bad things the way that senescent cells do by disabling their defenses against the bad things they're producing so and you know senescent cells in many respects are like cancer cells that don't divide and so it just turned out when we did our search based on the scott network the desatinib was a key that fit in the law quite well for some of these scot pathways for particular kinds of nested cells mainly mainly um cells in fat tissue and some others it we predicted it would not work on other senescent cells like cells that line blood vessels and it didn't so we were able to predict that bioinformatically uh back in 2013 when we first developed this strategy kercentin is a natural product it's in apple peels it's what makes apple apples taste better and it targets a number of uh pathways that are complementary to what the satin targets so the combination gives a broad spread of targets on these uh on the scott network and both drugs have short elimination half-lives tosatniv is an elimination half-life in humans of around four hours and carsetting around 11 hours so the dissatinav is completely gone from a person's body after around three half-lives in other words 12 hours parasatin is gone by about 36 hours so again we can give these drugs in a hit and run fashion and they're gone and they're not hanging around anymore uh to cause problems because of their presence you know we're not trying to continuously occupy a receptor or inhibit an enzyme we're trying to get rid of the cell type and once it's gone it's gone we don't need the drug around anymore we need a peak level for you know a matter of um you know a couple of hours and then we want the drug gone so that that's part of the reason we picked them the satin is normally given for leukemias and lymphomas at the same dose every day it's given every day to those people as we give once a month maybe or or twice a month for a centalytic effect so you know we're we're giving and and we know the safety profile of the satellite and we know it's generally it's not a typical chemotherapy drug it doesn't act the way that typical chemotherapy drugs do it acts by inhibiting enzymes that are on these pathways that allow cells to survive that are producing bad things so it doesn't work the way that a typical chemotherapy drug does and then kercetin is a flavonoid it's a natural product it's it's got a lot of things that it acts on but it acts on these nodes and again it's gone once we get rid of it physetin is closely related to carcinoma it's got a shorter elimination half-life around three hours so it's gone within 10 hours it's in strawberries and cucumbers and a whole lot of other things um and again we know um something about its safety profile we elected because it's got a short elimination half-life and it appears in pre-clinical studies and also in what we know from about people consuming it that it it doesn't seem to have a lot of side effects and so we elected to use it as in as on its own as a second strategy for certain kinds of indications in early phase clinical trials we're interested in a hit and run approach we want to get rid of these cells and we want the drug to be gone so the the um you know the usual rules about um pharmacokinetics go out the window and what we really want to know and these drugs um intestinal absorption is variable as with any kind of drug but you know what that's why in in the trials what we want to do is give a dose we know in preclinical studies is sufficient to kill senescent cells but is below way below the toxicity threshold for that drug so the alzheimer's trial is mainly a safety and feasibility trial it's open label it's looking at subjects for a few months before versus after starting intermittent analytics and this is in subjects with early but established alzheimer's disease and the the purpose of this particular phase of the alzheimer's studies is to know how big a placebo control trial is going to have to be so this involves subjects who are over 65 it's just beginning to enroll they've got intermediate alzheimer's diseases uh evident by cognitive function testing and looking at various markers including pet imaging um it's going to be a small trial it's mainly looking at target engagement as i mentioned and it's going to be of intermittent uh dysattnum and kercetin and this is based on uh studies in animal models where there appeared to be some alleviation of the of the alzheimer's like state that some mouse models have where we find that there are senescent cells in the parts of the brain that control memory and executive function uh and that uh centalytics in those animal models improve new nerve uh production uh reduce inflammation in the brain improve blood flow in the brain and decrease or even partially reverse brain shrinkage so we're seeing if that's true in patients with alzheimer's and patients with alzheimer's we know they have senescent cells in the hippocampi of the brain and the frontal lobes that control respectively memory and cognitive function uh there's a trial which is just beginning it's going to be in uh when it's fully rolled out in 129 nursing homes across the united states it's funded by the nih and this will be for uh patients who ha have who test positive or have tested positive for chronovirus who are nursing home residents we know that they have that they don't do very well so this trial is uh beginning in a small way at mayo affiliated nursing homes then it's going to spread across the translational geoscience network [Music] you
