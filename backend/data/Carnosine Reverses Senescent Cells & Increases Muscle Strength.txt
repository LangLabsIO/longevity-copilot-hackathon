[Music] I've been taking uh supplements for a long time like life extension mix and things like that I also take at least a gram and a half every day of carnosine I used to take three grams every day of carnosine carnosine seems to reverse uh what people call zombie cells so as you get as you get older as your cells divide after they've divided a certain number of times they become unable to divide and when they get to that stage of Life they start swelling up and looking ugly and they start spitting out nasty toxins that go out into the environment mess up all the cells around them so that's called cellular senescence but you can take a cell like that and put it in a culture dish and pour a little carnosine in there and it reverses the cell senescence so I noticed that I my muscle strength is as great as it ever will I'm 72. so uh I I used to be able to push up you know do like 72 push-ups at my Peak when I was young and weighed a lot less than I do now uh but uh um I don't think I'm any weaker now that I that I was in those days in fact after I'd been on trim x for a while I just felt so energetic I just thought I'd drop down and do some push-ups I just batted out like 90 push-ups so um I think that the carnosine is affecting stem cells so like uh senescent cells stem cells may become less competent over time and if you rejuvenate the stem cells then your muscles would continue to be able to repair themselves you wouldn't necessarily lose muscle mass with age the way you normally do so I've been on carnosine for a long time and it seems like it's working but there's all kinds of other things too foreign [Music]
