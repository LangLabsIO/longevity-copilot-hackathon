[Music] foreign I'm not the greatest of Health nuts I I do way too little exercise I don't do a lot of aerobics um I don't sleep very well but all the other stuff I I do my best to be a role model in terms of lifting weights eating the right foods and taking supplements regularly I play a symphony of supplements that is right for me and my microbiome when I was in my early 30s I started taking Resveratrol which now is pretty well known it's a red wine molecule it's found in grapes and what's great about Resveratrol is that it's belongs to a class of what I call Xeno hormetans Xeno means between species and hormetan means something that mimics adversity so what we're doing when we eat Resveratrol when I take Resveratrol is I'm mimicking what would happen if I ate food plants that are stressed out or dying or being preyed upon by bugs or dehydrated Resveratrol is made by plants Grapes of course but others when they are stressed when we make wine we stress The Grapes before we pick them because you get you know better flavor that's because these molecules go up as a stress response and I have this theory that when we eat those molecules our body will try to survive because the signal is that our food is dying okay so this is a very ancient millions of years old probably billions of signaling between food and the consumer of that food so that's Resveratrol the molecular mechanism is uh very well worked out it modulates a variety of processes in the body that defend us against aging it improves DNA repair for example it reduces free radical damage it lowers inflammation etc etc and we even study the enzyme one of the enzymes that it modulates called 31 um and I've spent a lot of my career figuring that stuff out but I've been taking Resveratrol one gram a day you need to mix it with something don't just swallow it with water with water because it's not soluble it'll pass through your gut so I mix it with a bit of yogurt in the morning a little bit sugar-free yogurt uh I'm I've become vegan now so at least as best I can I'm a struggling vegan so I have a bit of plant-based coconut based yogurt you can use a bit of olive oil but make sure there's something that you mix it with I open up capsules and dissolve it that's important the next molecule that I take is another one that we've studied in my lab for over a decade and it's called n m n okay I didn't say m M's I said nmn and nmn is short for nicotinamide mononucleotide and it is a a molecule that our body makes all the time but we make less of it as we get older and the less we have the less well this sort 1 enzyme protects the body and so I by taking in a man every day again it's a gram a day um sometimes I go down to half a gram um because I'm trying to titrate my testosterone but anyways from somewhere between half a gram and a gram I take and that is known in humans to raise the levels of a molecule called NAD that the cert1 enzyme needs to work as do about 400 other enzymes that are good for health and we don't want low naed levels because we have less energy we don't sleep well and our bodies don't fight against aging so that it's that nmn Resveratrol combo that I like Resveratrol is the accelerator pedal on the enzyme and NAD is the fuel the gas foreign [Music]
