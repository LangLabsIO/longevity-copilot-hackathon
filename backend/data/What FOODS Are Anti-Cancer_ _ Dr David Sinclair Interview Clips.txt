[Music] foreign the low-fat plant-based diets with high nutrition are the healthiest for cancer prevention and there are two main things that happen there your metabolism when you're on a plant-based um and a skipping a meal diet it turns over proteins and makes your in a metabolism that cancer cells do not like cancer cells by the way love sugar they live on sugar and that's another reason why you should try to keep it low cancer cells won't grow as well the other thing that happens is that these molecules that you get from plants Resveratrol is one another one I'll mention is ecgc from green tea I drink matcha tea most mornings which is the the very thick dark green creamy green tea this ecgc has great anti-inflammatory and anti-cancer properties and so there are a lot of foods you can eat that are that suppress tumors um and then so I've I've mentioned just to remind you if you have a pen uh if you eat plant-based food you'll have a better metabolism that doesn't allow cancers to grow uh but you'll also have these molecules from plants that are anti-cancer but there's a third thing I want to mention the older you get the more susceptible you are to cancer because an old body doesn't kill cancer cells as well as a young body and we all have cancer cells in our body all the time every day we have cancer starting up and our bodies kill it as we get older our bodies don't do that our immune system goes down and cancer can now multiply so if you stay young you probably won't get cancer foreign [Music]
