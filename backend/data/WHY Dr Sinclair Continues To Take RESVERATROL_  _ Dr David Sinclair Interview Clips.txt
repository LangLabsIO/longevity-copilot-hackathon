[Music] good well resveratrol is a core part of my life it's been i've been taking it since i was 34 and it's gone in and out of fashion you know the media old media likes to be swing this way extreme that way but the science has been pretty much direct on which is every week there's another study coming out either in cells or in animals and every few months in people um touting or showing that there are benefits and there are no downsides that i'm aware of so what thousands of papers now have shown is that resveratrol enhances the body's ability to repair itself it protects organs in animal studies and even in human studies it's shown some benefits for example lowers blood sugar levels which is what we think is important for overall longevity and it has even shown some uh benefits in alzheimer's patients in an australian study that was done a few years ago and so i've been taking resveratrol at a gram a day with a day off every couple of weeks just to give my liver a chance to rest but other than that um it's been a staple and the other thing i want to mention is the resveratrol is one of the best known molecules for uh preventing cancer at least in animals we don't know in humans that's a longer study but i take it for all those reasons and it's a very safe molecule it's been in our diet for thousands of years though not in the quantities that i'm taking of course i take a gram and if you often people ask me would i get it from red wine the answer is yes but you'd need to have 200 300 glasses a day of red wine which i do not recommend also don't forget as we've mentioned before to mix it with something oily or fatty or a lot of protein so a little bit of yogurt with yogurt's great it dissolves yeah so i'm not big on having a lot of protein especially early in the morning but i know it does dissolve so in the case of a zero fat greek yogurt do know from past experience that it does dissolve well in that if greek yogurt zero fat is your kind of thing well it's really important to look at the color of the molecules go online look at what color i kept this molecule should be um so some of them are yellow berberine and quercetin physique and there's they're generally yellow should be bright yellow not dirty yellow resveratrol is different residual is a light gray color very fluffy it'll it won't dissolve in water this is why it mix it with food and if it comes out brown you can open up the capsule look at it i often open up capsule and put it into my food i don't swallow it with food i mix it uh if it's not light gray or really close to white it's full of other stuff and some of the brown stuff that's in there causes diarrhea and and that's probably the least of the problems that could occur so i really look for really pure substances with my supplements i look for 98 99 pure supplements because it's this other you know 30 sometimes that is could be contaminants that could you could do long-term harm over decades of use so for example there's a product on our product there's a there's a substance called fote flti and that has a lot of resveratrol in it now that's been used for thousands of years in china and and that i think is is um you know an example of you can choose to have a biological product that's been taken uh by people for thousands of years but it's this the products that are trying to pretend to be pure that are not pure that i avoid yeah so the the molecules that we're talking about here are activating sirtuins and they so resveratrol acts like the accelerator pedal nad is the gas or the petrol if you're in a different uh country and together they they rip off the strategies so why is that important because the sutures and nad ramp up in activity in the morning it's part of the circadian rhythm the daily diurnal cycle as it's called and you want your body to be in sync with itself otherwise you have jet lag you get tired and so i take these molecules um almost without exception in the morning i feel this boost of energy because of it and if i take them late at night often i don't sleep well so that's very important there are other supplements such as metformin vitamin d k2 fish oil that i know or at least i the science says they don't affect sleep wake cycle sorry take those at night instead [Music] you
