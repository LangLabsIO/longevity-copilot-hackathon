[Music] so having high blood sugar is just known to accelerate aging there's no question about it but there's a couple of reasons that there's a very simple reason and a very um practical explanation which is that the glucose that circulates in your body can be used for fuel but it can also inadvertently get attached to your proteins and then when you've got this glucose attached to proteins they malfunction so that's part of this build up this way you want to have some intermittent fasting restricted feeding to turn over these glucoronidated proteins one of the ways to measure diabetes is to measure the glucose that's attached to your hemoglobin which is an abundant protein in your red blood cells and doctors take that measurement it's called hba1c that tells you how much glucose you've had in your body roughly for the last month because hemoglobin lost the in the body for about three months and it's turned over and that number gives you a good idea of whether you've been eating badly and or you've got type 2 diabetes which is the inability to utilize that blood sugar that's why it's important to measure it even when you're young don't want it to be going up and up and up by the time it's your type 2 diabetic it's often too late and so i measure i've been measuring mine for the last over a decade so that's one problem with glucose it'll attach to proteins and make them malfunction and it's a sign of type 2 diabetes by the way the numbers are based on the percentage of your hemoglobin that has glucose attached to it stuck to it anything below 5 is really great between 5 and 7 is pre and then roughly and then over seven then you gotta you know be worried and your doctor will start to treat it and one of the drugs that's used wills metformin but but what's also important i think is to understand that there's probably another mechanism to how this is working because it's not just about blood sugar by activating this ampk you actually i'm going to take it a real quick step back but there are three main things that keep us healthy when we feel hormesis or do hormesis you've mentioned mtor which is sensing amino acids the ones that i work on are called sirtuins they measure nad and a whole bunch of stress in the body exercise diet the one that we're talking about is the third one which is called ampk and it registers the amount of energy in the body glucose and chemical energy which is called atp that mitochondria make and as we get older our body makes less and less energy and ampk is the control system and ampk is activated by a bunch of things which uh include being hungry and exercising or taking the drug metformin that's probably why they're all good for you because it turns on these defenses and so think of it think of your glucose as doing two things one is sticking to proteins and wrecking the proteins and you need to turn those over by fasting or eating less regularly but also if you always have sugar in your body high levels either diabetically just eating cake every day or or sugar in your coffee what you're doing is telling the body there's an abundance right now and your ampk defenses are not turned on unless you take metformin which might bypass that but what i try to do in my life is to turn on all of those three systems the sortuans with boosting nad apk by taking metformin and exercising and then the mtor not taking an abundance of those three amino acids i mentioned leucine isoleucine valine and together i think they work as a system we know they talk to each other tweak one the other works we don't know what the optimal combination is that i'm experimenting on myself [Music] you
