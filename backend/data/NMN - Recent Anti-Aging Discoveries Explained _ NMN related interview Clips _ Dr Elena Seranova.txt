[Laughter] [Music] it's a very important molecule and what we can what we can see here is that it's basically affecting the function of of multiple organs and how they function or nad is being affected by multiple factors such as exercise so for example exercise can boost our nad levels or we can actually consume some foods that are reached in nad such as some some fish tuna sardines mushrooms as well and so on and we can also uh take some nad boosters which are basically molecules that can boost the production of nad in our bodies and as you can see here for a plethora of organs nad plays quite a crucial role and um if we take it one step further and see what's going on um at a molecular level we can see that nad is implicated in um in chromosome stability and dna repair um because it also serves as a substrate for for for different molecular players such as parps which is a very important family of of of enzymes that is basically regulating dna repair and so on uh sir tunes as well that ha that are uh playing a role in in longevity different longevity mechanisms so for example certain one uh it's regulating multiple processes such as autophagy but also um dna repair as well and in fact uh whenever we have dna break somewhere in in the cell uh certain one is one of the uh of the first players that are getting inside of the damage and trying to repair this uh sir two and three has to do with mitochondrial function and how much mitochondria we're actually producing so mitochondrial biogenesis which is a very important process and without it we won't be having um any energy production uh and then it's implicated in in brain health and neurotransmitter health um there is a bunch of studies out there demonstrating the role of nad in immune cell signaling as well and and energy enzyme activity um longer telomeres and so on and what we're seeing here is that there are actually three ways to synthesize nad in the body so there is the um there is a pathway called called press handler pathway there is the de novo synthesis um of nad that uh that can be affected by the amino acid tryptophan and there is also this pathway here where basically we do uh we can consume foods that that could be containing uh nr nicotinamide riboside that would then be converted into animen and then the nmn would be converted into one step into nad so as we previously said there are different nad boosters out there in a supplement um there there is even nicotinamide riboside um in a supplement that people can take however it needs to be converted into animen first and then it does produce the nad in the cell we recently have discovered a transporter um that is basically ensuring that animan is being transported into the cell easily so it does have increased bioavailability and um and what we're seeing here is that um as it basically orchestrates so many physiological functions it's also very important to mention that as we age nad is being decreased and that's the primary reason why we actually need to um to basically supplement with an nad booster to make sure that all of this essential processes in the cell are being um taken care of and we do have enough nad for everything to function well so sirtuin sparks and other other enzymes they are using nad as a substrate as a fuel to function and without it they won't be able to do their job well and obviously this is the reason why nad is so important so um from what we've seen so far there are multiple studies showing benefits of any of nad boosting molecules in animals such as mice and then most recently we also had a couple of human studies uh coming out this year that are basically replicating those effects in in humans so we can basically um go ahead and then um and then have a look at what we've seen so far so far in terms of insulin increase in diabetes in animal studies and there are actually quite a few studies out there showing that there are multiple beneficial effects um in in basically wild-type mice and also um diet and age-induced um type 2 diabetic mice and what we're seeing is that um nmn is very well tolerated at a quite a big dosage and then also they show improved insulin sensitivity uh as well as plasma lipid profile um after long-term administration of nmn and we're seeing here that after 12 months of nmn um we do have a significant in senseless sensitivity compared to the body weight match control group and not only that but if we have a closer look at this study we will see that there are various factors that have been positively affected than a man treated mice included including the um the age-related body gain that was basically um that was basically improved because as we age we basically gain weight much easier because our metabolism slows down um the energy metabolism the the insulin sensitivity were all affected uh as well as the lipid metabolism here and then uh scientists also also shown that there are there there were beneficial changes in gene expression and mitochondrial oxidative metabolism and so on along with a couple of other symptoms including eye function and bone density and so on so this study was quite um quite detailed and um again 12 months of of mouse life is actually quite a long time so uh this would equal to uh many many years of of an event supplementation in humans just for just for i'd worked with mice in the past and they were live around two years three years max that's that's yeah some of the mice that you were using yes yeah that's correct i think that a 34 month old mouse is an equivalent of a 90 year old human something like that yeah so um if we go into human studies now so there is there is a study that has been published a couple of months ago uh in pre-diabetic women uh that showed that supplementation with animen for 10 weeks at um only 250 mg of anime on a on a daily basis uh in pre-diabetic postmenopausal obese or overweight women um demonstrated that um this women basically had increased insulin sensitivity and muscle remodeling as well um they had an increase of nad intermediates as well in their blood um uh suggested basically higher nad turnover and what uh what the um the researchers commented on the study is that the improvement that they saw in muscle insulin sensitivity in this study is basically similar to the improvement someone would see after 10 weight loss so for example if you're um if you're let's say um 70 kg this would mean that you would lose 7 kg of body weight in order to see this kind of improvement so quite a big deal and what uh what they're also saw um in the muscle content as well is that there was um there was no change in in the content of nad and nicotinamide which is another precursor however what we're seeing here is that there was an in a significant increase in the intermediates of nad basically suggesting that nmn um is is basically absorbed and then it's increasing the overall nad turnover turnover in muscle tissue so this is very very good news because um i heard someone arguing the other day that um actually um accumulation of nmn or nicotinamide would be toxic in cells but what we're seeing is that we do have quite a rapid turnover and quite a rapid absorption of nmn meaning that there is no toxic toxic buildup in tissues and we only can see beneficial effects of animal supplementation now in terms of endothelial function and muscle benefits of animen there is something uh quite interesting going on here because there is the um uh we already know that there is um a decrease of our uh of our anti again angiogenesis which is the can i enter for a second can you tell the public the audience what is endothelium what is endothelium just for the information so it's basically um the endothelial cells are the cells that are related to our uh vasculature that are making our our our arteries and and and so on so it's basically cells that are um that are essential for us to to create new arteries and so on and new blood vessels so um what we're seeing here is that as we age our ability to to build new vessels and new arteries is decreasing this would lead to decreased blood flow in different tissues including the muscle tissues and this is why we're seeing basically decreased decreased muscle retention as we age so this is a condition that is called sarcopenia which means that we lose our muscles as we age we lose our our muscle mass so what's going on here is that um this phenomenon is uh quite tightly related to the fact that we we are not able to supply more blood into our muscles in order to maintain it and this is uh this is why it kind of atrophies so what we're seeing here is that with um with supplementation with um with n men or nr in mice uh which is the other nad booster is that we are boosting the ability of the body to create new vessels and new new arteries and so on in order to support muscle function so this is what has been demonstrated in mice um for quite a few years now actually and then this year there were two human studies that um came out in humans that have uh have shown um that uh supplementation with anime from 250 mg of and up to 1.2 grams is uh first it's safe all right so this was a very important finding from this study and then from there um the first study was in 10 elderly healthy men that were 65 years old and over um and then what they what they saw in the study is that anime raised the nad serum levels and prevent prevented age-related muscle dysfunction now the second study was um was a bit more interesting in my opinion so we actually had uh four groups of participants one was a placebo group that was not taking any animal and then they had three groups that were taking either 300 milligrams of elements 600 or 1.2 grams of animen for six weeks and then they evaluated uh the aerobic capacity and the cardiovascular fitness of the participants that were healthy adults of mixed gender from 27 years old to 50 years old and they were amateur runners so what they saw in this in the study was that their um their um their ventilatory threshold was increased so basically how they utilize oxygen um the the capacity of their uh body to utilize oxygen was increased the v duo mask um the vt1 so ventilatory threshold one um that is basically when um let's say you're uh you're running or you're doing some sort of another um aerobic capacity uh like cycling and then at some point you start breathing happily because now your uh your your tissues are requiring more oxygen this is the ventilatory threshold one that was improved in this study and then uh the ventilatory threshold too is the condition where you're basically running out of breath after heavy exercise this was also um this was also improved in this study so quite an interesting study and it was really nice that they had different different groups that were taking different dosages of nmn that they were testing and both of those studies were where placebo controlled as well so they they both had a placebo group that was not taking any nmn as well so they were able to compare the results here question uh question what was the improvement by how much do we have an idea about how much was the improvement um i don't i don't have this data at the moment yeah but i think that i actually have an extra slide here that i wasn't um um i i i wasn't sure if i'm going to show it or not so i think that once because you asked me we can as well uh go here and see what's going on in the study and what was exactly the the outcome so um basically what what we saw during the ventilatory threshold one that we described um admin managed to increase the heart rate uh of the participants which is basically beneficial because uh this means that you can again utilize better the oxygen it's related to the oxygen consumption um that the participants have in the study um and then it it improved the the overall power so basically the um the endurance of the participants and it increased the oxygen maximum oxygen consumption as well now during um during the ventilatory threshold too the animal supplementation also managed to to improve the overall uh power but not the other um not the other indicators that they they they studied they they were recording in the study however i think that it would be really interesting to uh to kind of compare this data in a study that would be measuring the same uh biomarkers but in different populations because here uh we we should mention that all of the participants were healthy so perhaps in in either older participants or participants with certain health conditions the results would be different because here the population was very healthy to start with um from the start and then also what they what they managed to um to to demonstrate here is that the cardiopulmonary metrics were not affected or improved by nmn however when they looked at some indicators of skeletal muscle related function they did see a significant improvement meaning that basically again animan is helping your muscles to utilize as much oxygen as possible and it would be very interesting to see [Music] a study that would basically be investigating whether anime could have the same effect as we saw in in mice where there is increased um increased production of angiogenesis so increased production of uh of of new blood vessels and just to summarize this study basically um in in this six weeks um study first of all um it was really nice to see that the these researchers armed up the dosage of phenomenon up to 1.2 grams we didn't have such a study before but here they demonstrated that it's completely safe and then they they did basically suggest that um the exercise that those participants were doing during the six-week period combined with animen uh enhance the the vt-1 the ventilatory threshold and then the other uh indicators that we mentioned here including the um this skeleton muscle related function and um what what they concluded is that nmn supplementation is basically um is basically increased the ventilatory threshold compared to exercise alone because again they did have a placebo group where participants were just working out for these six weeks but they were not taking any men and um they concluded that this is due to increased oxygen utilization by the skeletal muscle [Music]
