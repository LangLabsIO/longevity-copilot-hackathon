[Music] the brain actually ages quite slowly relative to other organs and it's partly because it's protected from toxins it's got a special blood brain barrier that protects it it also has very good defense mechanisms but it's not perfect and it's actually susceptible to damage because those cells typically don't divide in your brain you have to protect them because it's very hard to fix them though we are working on that and i think our next slide we're going to cover that part of the brain age reversal and reprogramming but before that technology's ready let's just talk about things that we could do today uh we'll talk about those things that we can implement today to slow down the aging of the brain yeah and so to maintain the identity of your neurons your neurons don't become more like skin and fail uh there are certain diets that we we believe slow down aging there are a number of studies now that point to that not just showing that you have improved health but there's one study that showed that switching to a mediterranean-like diet most more plant-based than than meat also with a little bit of red wine if you wanted mostly um olive oil rather than the saturated fatty oils from animals and the studies show that there's these changes to cell identity uh we can measure this with what's called the dna methylation clock also known as the horvath clock it actually takes more slowly when you eat a mediterranean diet which is another reason for saying that we should focus more on plants and these types of foods but plants also contain molecules in them that that activate the body's defenses against aging and uh and that's another reason i take anime they also activate saturn's but let me talk about one study there was one longitudinal study so looking at almost 2 000 people and there was a 10 reduction in dementia risk for each time they uh they switched into a mediterranean-like diet and it correlated with better memory and better cognitive performance for those people just one of many studies showing that what you eat really affects not just how intelligent and how much you can remember this week but decades later and that's so important to to start early because sometimes it can be too late once dementia is really set in it's really hard to reverse it at that stage uh yeah so if you look in my fridge a lot of vegetables i have on dark green vegetables so this would be a lot of spinach i have um broccoli um glass with sulforaphane in there will be very beneficial and to boost the body's defenses against dna damage no it drives the epigenetic changes and the clock um so yeah it's that's it with legumes um sunflower seeds i eat seeds during the day occasionally bite of chopped little dark chocolate catechins in it which are also very protective and can also boost mitochondria and matcha green tea the one that we think is most potent scientists think is ecgc antioxidant but also is able to boost mitochondria like metformin by inhibiting it and causing a little bit of stress to those mitochondria so they react and produce more of themselves yeah so most of the things you should uh boost the levels of a protein called bdnf and similar to nerve growth factor ngf that i mentioned earlier it's really important for maintaining nerve cell health and the growth of new nerves and soybeans showing that you can grow new nerves in a process um that's called urogenesis and bdnf is very important for that as well forming new uh what are called synapses and what we find we in my lab and other scientists find that as we get older bdnf levels go down and the brain doesn't heal and grow and remember things very well and by maintaining the bdaf levels uh during aging by eating these types of foods it has remarkable benefits uh ecgc for example uh matcha tea regularly have a 35 less chance of getting dementia and there's lots of studies showing that so this idea that diet uh isn't just improving you know the taste and your your body metabolism it's actually affecting your brain that's something a lot of people fail to actually think about excuse the pun but it's super important that we protect the brain because there's really like i said there's no point having a really healthy body if your brain starts to age first [Music] you
