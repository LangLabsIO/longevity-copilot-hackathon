[Music] yeah i've switched to be much more planned focused and feel the benefits and see the benefits of my blood work which i do fairly regularly but it's taking supplements even though we've shown in animals and others have shown in people that can mimic exercise can mimic fasting this it's not an excuse to sit on the couch and just pop pills you've met people that eat terrible diets and take a supplement thinking that that will replace a healthy diet and that's not true what we have shown in my lab and others many others have shown is that you need to do both to get the biggest bang for the buck and you can't just expect supplements to replace a healthy diet and i also sort of question uh what about the carnivore diet i talk a lot about this um the summary is that you know there's a big debate there's the carnivores and there's the vegans and they're seemingly opposed now in the in the short run both have been shown to have benefits but the question is what about long-term health and there the science speaks volumes love for a carnivore diet to be associated with long life i wish that were true because i love meat just not the case you know speaking as a scientist if you look at people who eat certain diets the people that live longest are those that don't eat a lot don't eat three big meals a day they eat less than that and they are mostly plant focused they don't eat meat all the time especially processed meat we know that of course that is the worst but even large amounts of meat what happens uh is that you're you can be in two different states there's the abundance state or the adversity state the adversity state is when the body thinks well times are tough i could starve i could get into trouble i need to run away from a saber-toothed tiger we also call this hormesis if anyone's listening to us before hormesis is what doesn't kill you makes you live longer and both diets will will have an impact either on one or the other of course the carnivore diet is the abundant state there's lots of amino acids build muscle uh grow uh heal uh wounds that's what that state is and it'll actually be very good in the short run there's really no question you will build up muscle uh probably you know slightly faster certainly uh more fast than if you're only on plant-based but the problem is that if you stay with that for decades the science says that it's not going to be as healthy in the long run as being on a plant-based diet now you can have a really nutritious um plant-based diet that will be as good as the meat-based diet for for physical and mental capabilities but in the long run we'll be turning on these defense pathways that in large part are controlled by m which stands for mammalian target of rapamycin so we get to this drug rapamycin rapamycin is a drug that was discovered on the island easter island rappanui and hence the rapid name and it's used in high doses to tone down the immune system so it doesn't the body doesn't reject organs but it was also shown to inhibit this mtor enzyme that senses amino acids and meat consumption particularly leucine and syrian these are abundant in need not so much available in plants so the the summary is that if you eat a lot of meat your mtor um defenses will not be as active against aging as if you're on a plant-based diet but you can mimic a plant-based diet and fasting by taking rapamycin the drug but not in high doses of course you don't want to unregulate your immune system but just inhibit it a little bit so that it's as though you're not eating a lot of meat and then you'll turn on this autophagy recycling proteins that's very good fail but you should know you can't just go out and buy rapamycin you do need to talk to your doctor it's actually not that easy to get so that's why i typically just skip meals it has a very similar effect [Music] [Music] you
