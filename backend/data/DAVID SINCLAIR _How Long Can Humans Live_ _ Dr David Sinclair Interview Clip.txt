[Laughter] [Music] [Applause] so one question is how long can humans live and we touched on that that there is no biological limit there's no laws as we have to age uh how soon could we reach 150 well i'm on record saying that if this trajectory holds and this reprogramming turns out to be safe the first person to make it to 150 might already be alive um and we have to remember that that were the longer we live the better technology we have access to and even five years ago we didn't know how to reverse aging now we do you know what's it like 100 well if you can make it another 50 years what is the world can be like um so that's that's what gives me optimism a lot of people who don't read the book and don't understand what we're talking about um do worry about all the negatives you know there there are the optimus uh which the two of us are but then there's the people that say any big change has to be a negative it can't be positive and so their mind goes to oh is it like dorian gray are you going to have a horrible life if you get older is it going to destroy the planet these are questions that that i get asked a lot and i do address in my book for that reason i i don't think that's good that's so much science fiction i mean right now clearly it's it is fiction but it's not out of the realm of possibility that you go in you have a an infusion in an injection uh you take a an antibiotic that turns on the genes that you're given and over the next two weeks you you literally do get younger your eyesight gets better you you look younger you feel better um i i want to just ask there are two things one is the 25 year checkup uh is is definitely not going to happen we are going to have nanosecond check checkups we already can do that with rings and watches and eventually sensors and even now you can do your own checkup with a blood test and have a.i look at your your biomarkers and give you suggestions we're it's we're entering a world where if you're not measuring yourself you're missing out on so much information you know if we if we take a pill or we do exercise or go on intermittent fasting unless you're measuring something about yourself you have no idea if it's working uh we have to get away from the mindset of the annual physical where the doctor makes you cough and takes your blood pressure that's so 20th century really is ridiculous yeah the the second thing that i was uh wanting to mention um was more about the ability to to measure one's age we we all assume that we're as old as our birthday candles but that that doesn't have to be true uh my father is physically 30 years younger i haven't changed physically or mentally since i was probably 20. and so when you ask people what age would they like to be you know for me it's somewhere between the ages of 20 and 51 it's all the same to me [Music] [Music]
