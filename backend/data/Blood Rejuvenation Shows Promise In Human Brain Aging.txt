[Music] so the field has made tremendous mind-boggling progress in finding interventions in mice now mice are far away from humans but in these models interventions that Target metabolism such as caloric restriction exercise various small molecules removal of cells that age in our tissues are called senescent cells or reprogramming of cells in the body where you try to make the cells younger again by removing some of the so-called epigenetic marks on the DNA or treatment with young blood with what we have been working on and I'll tell you a little bit more about it um all these interventions make mice physically and molecularly younger they slow down the aging process and these mice actually often look younger than their siblings that are not treated so we believe that we can we can intervene directly in the aging process in these organisms and that has led to a flurry of Publications with amazing discoveries but also to Investments you may have seen altuslab with just tremendous amounts of funding three billion dollars in trying to tackle this problem and and really Target aging as almost as if it were a disease to try to slow down and reverse than multiple age-related diseases and Juan Carlos espisoa who is one of the leading scientists in this field has been quoted that within two decades we will be able to prevent aging now I know Juan Carlos I'm sure he did not say that but that's how he was quoted um so but but it's real there is really a a rapid development in applying some of these Technologies and and showing that in complex organisms such as a mouse you can have um really uh impacts that slow down and reverse the aging process now we have been focusing on one of the central tissues in our body the blood and there's of course the saying Young Blood Rejuvenation with blood and we ask the question what if we would be able to rejuvenate the blood so if we look at the blood at the composition of blood in a young versus an old organism we can actually show that the are dramatic changes and here's just an illustration of that so what we look at here are three thousand different proteins in the blood of healthy individuals age 20 to almost 100 and in the colors we show in blue the a low level of a protein and in yellow high levels of a protein so you have 4 300 people that we line up here from left to right and for each person we measure these three thousand proteins and you can see the dramatic changes that occur with aging so young people have a completely different composition of the blood than all people and that makes you wonder and maybe understand that if we change now the blood of an old person to a young one maybe this will have an effect and indeed that's what we were able to find multiple other labs that if we use sort of a surgical Paradigm where we connect two mice at their flanks such that they're able to exchange from young to old or we actually give old mice repeated infusions of young blood we can rejuvenate multiple organs such as the heart muscle liver kidney bone pancreas and aorta and multiple Labs have been able to reproduce these findings now my lab has focused on the brain specifically and here we were able to show that they're more stem cells in the brain that can make new nerve cells new neurons there is more chatter there's more communication between the cells in the brain there is less inflammation and most importantly these mice become smarter so the old mice they have the same problem that humans have as we get older we start to forget things and we have Behavior tests for mice where we can measure that but if we give them young blood they do better again in these tests they function better and we were unable indeed able to translate this into humans so in a number of clinical research studies that are still ongoing first at the Alzheimer's Research Center here at Stanford and then at a startup that I founded and later by a large company that makes blood products that collect plasma donations from many donors and infractionates that what these studies show that in in early studies multiple infusions of plasma from Mostly young donors on average 35 years of age show sort of promising signs in small proof of concept and dosing studies and excitingly a large study that has actually more than 500 patients the company Grifols removed first their old blood and then gave infusions of young plasma or refraction of plasma that is rich in albumin and what they can show is significant benefits in disease progression improving the memory in these individuals and also improving their daily functioning suggesting that what we discover in the mice and what works in the mice might actually work in people as well of course we want to understand how exactly does that work what are the components in this blood that are able to do this and move this forward hopefully into the clinic so that we can help people foreign [Music]
