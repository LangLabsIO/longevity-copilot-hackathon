[Music] so [Music] what we do know we know that uh from my lab into mouse models of cancer one was breast cancer one was liver cancer yeah um and this was done in the lab that's co-run by lindsey woo down at sydney that nmn did not accelerate any cancer in those two models in fact in the breast cancer model it actually slowed the growth of cancer okay so in my hands we haven't seen any evidence for it we've fed enemento mice for many many months i think actually we fed it for them for the whole life span and there was no increased spontaneous cancer yeah okay so where does this idea come from there are two reasons to question the possibility of cancer uh again they're in mice so one is comes from a study that we showed that nmn boosts blood vessel formation okay so we didn't look in cancer we looked in muscle and when you give nmn to a mouse an old mouse it will have more muscle more blood vessels and it will have better blood flow and we also published with with another group that the brain gets better blood flow as well okay which is all good for aging um it may not be good for cancer if you have a big tumor that needs blood flow i would be cautious very cautious actually that in a man or maybe resveratrol i'm not sure about resveratrol it hasn't been studied um but uh so that's one concern if if i had a big tumor i probably wouldn't take any men just to be safe okay and then the second thing was um there was a study that came out of washington university in saint louis and what they they showed in this study was that if you took a brain cancer cell line and you knock down nad levels so you you got rid of the enzyme that makes nad now now those cells didn't grow very well and they didn't make uh it was a glioblastoma in the brain okay okay all right so what does that prove well it proves that cells need nad to survive to grow well we knew that a hundred years ago that's not a surprise but the experiment that they needed to do was to increase nad and show if that causes cancer which they didn't show they didn't test that and where what happened was the publicity department at the university wrote a press release that says that this work shows that nad can cause cancer which is not what they showed and it went all over the internet unfortunately which is a misinterpretation of that data good to know right so basically in simple language if you take four wheels off a car it won't drive but if you put six wheels on a car will it go six times faster no well or you know put eight wheels on a car will it go twice as fast no it won't so you cannot interpret an experiment that goes one direction and say oh if you do the opposite the opposite will happen so that's why i continue to take a man i haven't seen anything that concerns me if if i did you know i'm not crazy i would stop immediately and tell the world that i've stopped taking it um and my my father as well i certainly wouldn't want my father to harm himself at age 80. and then there's the clinical trials we've been doing safety studies with nad boosting molecules other labs probably four other labs have done this in humans and not seen anything yet but you know again i'm a scientist so i would say we need long-term studies we need to test for five years and look at thousands of people and that would tell us if there's a worry absolutely makes perfect sense yeah that explains it that explains it yeah so there is a theory that decreased nad in tumors would actually prevent the par enzymes uh from repairing tumors dna and hence make the tumor more sensitive to chemotherapy so this is why parp inhibitors actually used for uh for for treating cancers but um we actually have evidence that uh in mice there is no increase in human growth when taking any animal and this has been shown in multiple studies and not only that but in humans there was a study where participants that previously had skin cancer after the the cancers were removed they were taking nad boosters and not only there was no stimulation of of new growth of cancer or cells but they they it looked like the the nad boost and supplementation basically um made healthy cells to grow um to to grow faster so this is really interesting and the reason why cancer and anime are are brought up together sometimes is that um in the biology of aging and in the biology of cancer there are some similarities so there are some some genes that are upregulated such as hif1 so this is a hypoxia gene and so on there is a complex role of nad in cancer but however what we're seeing is that it looks like we still don't understand the mechanism very well but what we're seeing in terms of the evidence is that nad supplementation definitely doesn't cause cancer it's important to always say that in many biological process there are some processes that we still don't understand how they work and they they could potentially um you know act as a double-edged sword but this doesn't mean that everyone would be affected so for instance you know there is the study with the uh with the skin cancer that has shown that nad boosters are not um you know are are not bad for uh for patients that previously had skin cancer however this doesn't mean that more research doesn't need to be done of course we need to kind of investigate different kind of cancers and how they are affected um and so on and also there are other processes that could that could be beneficial in one context but not another but this doesn't mean that they are bad processes so the same applies to let's say the process of photophagy in the cell which is the process by which the cell is kind of clearing up the toxins and the junk proteins that are floating around in the cell because autophagy is a very very beneficial process and um in cancer in some cancers actually um they're hijacking this mechanism of autophagy in order to survive so it's not that the autophagy process is really bad for you it's actually really good and you know this is why people do intermittent fasting and all these things but uh in some particular instances it might be um it might be bad however we know how to modulate this there are some autophagy inhibitors that could be applied um locally and so on and you know this goes on with with um this applies to different processes in the cell and there is no such thing as categorizing one particular process in the cell as being very bad in all contexts we just need more research however um just to summarize uh definitely the data that uh i'm seeing so far look very very good and you know even in uh in a mouse cancer model where mice already had tumors and they were supplemented with animen the tumors didn't show accelerated growth so this was a really nice study as well [Music] you
