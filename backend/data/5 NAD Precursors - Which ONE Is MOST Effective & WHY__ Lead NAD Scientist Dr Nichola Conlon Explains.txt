[Music] understanding NAD biology can be very complex and even in this very simplified diagram you can see that there is a lot going on there are multiple precursors that NAD can be made from there are multiple Pathways that can make NAD and they're just there are just as many Pathways that can also degrade and break down NAD it can also be recycled and it can flip between oxidized and reduced States so if you really want to understand how to efficiently boost NAD then you really need to understand all the biology behind it so first of all what are NAD precursors well basically in NAD precursor is the raw material that the body uses to make NAD it's like the building blocks for NAD and there are five different precursors that the body can use it can use tryptophan nicotinic acid nicotinamide nicotinamide ribose guide or nicotinamide mononucleotides and apart from tryptophan which is an amino acid the rest of the NAD precursors are actually vitamin B3 derivatives so a key question is how do these precursors compare and how do they make NAD so first of all let's cover tryptophan because tryptophan is somewhat of an outlier because unlike the rest of the precursors it's an amino acid and it's made into NAD by a pathway called the de novo pathway which occurs mostly in the liver and the kidneys but this pathway is known to make only a very small contribution to overall NAD production so it's not really spoken about as much as the other pathways so what about all the other precursors the vitamin B3 derivatives well this is where it becomes slightly more complicated and it's because there's often confusion about the difference between the precursors because of the way that they are named so vitamin B3 and niacin are used interchangeably as an umbrella term to refer to a multiple vitamin B3 derivatives for example you'll often see both nicotinic acids and nicotinamide labeled as niacin even though they are structurally different and they have very different effects in the body for example nicotinic acid is known to help reduce cholesterol whereas nicotinamide does not have this effect nicotinic acid is also known to activate receptors that cause a really intense and somewhat unpleasant flushing sensation in the skin whereas again nicotinamide does not have this effect so it's rather confusing that they are both grouped together under the name of niacin and just to confuse things a little further nicotinamide is also sometimes referred to as niacinamide but they are the same thing now the general reason for this is that although these compounds are structurally different and have different effects in the body they ultimately end up down the same biological Pathways so the term niacin equivalent sometimes abbreviated as n e is used as an umbrella term to describe the contribution to dietary intake of all the forms of niacin that are available to the body but when it comes to NAD the vitamin B3 derivatives that have been investigated most extensively are nicotinamide nicotinamide ribosides and nicotinamide mononucleotides and no matter what the precursor they all end up in one of two different NAD production Pathways at various points and these are the priest Handler pathway or the Salvage pathway and out of all the NAD biosynthesis Pathways the Salvage pathway at the top here is actually considered to be the primary source of cellular NAD production this is because as well as being able to use multiple precursors as the raw material such as nicotinamide NR or nmn it also plays a big role in recycling NAD that is being broken down in the cell so which is the best precursor to use to boost NAD and a question that I get asked all the time is why do we use nicotinamide as part of our NAD boost in supplement The Tutor Time plus rather than the more popular precursors such as NR or nmn well this is an intense area of debate and there are a number of reasons for this so first of all we know that once nicotinamide NR and nmn get inside of the cells they all do lead to varying degrees of NAD production but the big hurdle that many people don't consider is actually getting the precursor into the cell in the first place because this is where the NAD production Pathways live so they can take the precursor and actually make it into NAD and cells don't just let anything pass in and out in fact the passage of molecules across the cell membrane is highly controlled and what we know is that both NR and nmn require special transport channels to cross into the cell membrane and into the cells and not all cell types actually have these channels whereas nicotinamide has been shown to be freely diffusable across the cell membrane and less reliant on active transport this means it can be absorbed by many more cells which is favorable because any D is required by all cells so we want to boost it in as many cells as possible another reason is that although NR and nmn do increase NAD Studies have shown that when taken orally NR seems to get entirely metabolized to nicotinamide in the liver before it's then released into systemic circulation where it enters the cells and is then converted to NAD suggesting that when you're using NR you are really just using nicotinamide to make NAD also with nmn some Studies have suggested that the majority of nmn is metabolized into NR before it's then taken up by the cells and finally we know that nicotinamide is the preferred precursor for the body it is a physiological circulating NAD precursor that the majority of our NAD is naturally made from NAD is not made solely from NR or nmn in normal physiological circumstances and just to note some people say that a drawback of nicotinamide is that high doses May inhibit the certuins which are NAD dependent proteins that promote the cellular health and coordinate many of the beneficial effects of NAD and this makes the use of nicotinamide seem counter-intuitive but the studies that are often quoted to support this Theory have all been conducted in vitro meaning they're done in cells in culture using exceptionally high concentrations of nicotinamide that would never be reached under normal physiological circumstances in the body this is because in our bodies the Salvage pathway efficiently converts any leftover nicotinamide into fresh NAD meaning that any nicotinamide is unlikely to hang around long enough inside at healthy cells as it's rapidly converted to NAD to maintain tissue homeostasis foreign [Music] [Music] foreign
