[Music] foreign supplements it can be hard to know if they are really working some people may feel a difference immediately whilst for others noticeable changes may be absent or more gradual so how would you really know if dietary supplements are working and actually having a real impact on your body well this is where clinical trials become important to test what the supplements are actually doing at the cellular level for example when people take the NAD boost in supplement digital time plus some people feel an immediate benefit for example increased energy and less brain fog whilst in other people the effects are more subtle but the key thing is that if you don't feel a change our clinical trial has demonstrated that the positive effects that the formulation is having at the cellular level so you can rest assured that even if you can't immediately feel anything The Tutor Time plus is actually having a positive impact on your cellular health so what's actually happening inside your cells when you take the Cheeto time plus well we know that even after your first few servings of material time plus your NAD will begin to increase in our clinical trial cellular NAD levels were significantly increased in just seven days of taking the supplement your cells will respond by immediately beginning to use this extra NAD to not only enhance energy production in the mitochondria but also to support the maintenance and repair of the mitochondria which prevent prevents them from becoming dysfunctional which is a key driver of cellular aging now this increase in energy is unlike the buzz experience from stimulants such as coffee this is a much more sustained energy boost as nichiro time plus is actually restoring natural energy production at the cellular level some customers feel notable improvements in mental health and physical energy very quickly and for others the improvements are more gradual and subtle and generally those people that seem to experience the most immediate improvements are those people with the most depleted NAD in the first place foreign plus your NAD levels will continue to rise over the weeks this increased availability of NAD will help switch on cellular repair Pathways to repair any cellular damage that's accumulated due to NAD deficiency that is built up over the years nature time plus works very differently to many other NAD boosters because it's actually designed to fix the root causes of NAD Decline and to restore youthful NAD production so scientists now agreed that one of the major causes of NAD decline as we get older is because a key pathway within our cells called the Salvage pathway that actually makes and recycles all of our NAD naturally declines with age now the reason it declines is because the key rate limiting enzyme in this pathway which is an enzyme called nampt declines as we get older which means our cells can't efficiently make and recycle NAD like they did when they were younger foreign plus is designed to switch back on this nampt enzyme to restore youthful NAD production and Recycling and you can see that in a clinical trial cellular levels of the nempt enzyme were increased in the participants of the clinical trial after only 28 days this means that your cells can now use and recycle NAD with youthful efficiency this can be felt as an increase in mental and physical energy we notice better sleep reduced brain fog increased strength and stamina we see improvements in skin health and also an improved ability to recover from illness after 28 days natural time plus was also found to reduce levels of inflammation we know that inflammation is a key driver of the aging process and we demonstrated that neutero time plus is actually suppressing some of this age-related inflammation another notable benefit that may not be immediately visible on the outside is a reduction in your biological age this is the rate at which your cells are aging on the inside and this is because NAD is known to positively impact all of the Hallmarks of Aging which are the root causes that are underlying or driving the aging process at the cellular level and in our clinical study nichido time plus was found to reduce biological age by an average of 1.26 years after only 28 days of supplementation now this was measured using the glyconage biological age test which is available as a consumer kit allowing you to test the effect of niter time Plus on your own biological age and although biological age is not something that we generally feel Studies have shown that it is a good predictor of how well you are aging and how healthy you are likely to be in the future NAD boost in in general should be seen as a long-term investment in your cellular Health everything to do with aging ultimately starts at the cellular level so it's important to ensure that your cells stay in good health and even in those people who do not see an immediate benefit or feel an immediate benefit what we do find is that through continued use as you continue to enhance your NAD levels and improve your cellular Health Energy and repair will actually start to be directed towards more non-essential parts of our body such as our hair skin and nails and many people report better hair and nail growth and in terms of both quality and maybe less Grays and improved skin glow and youthfulness so overall improving your NAD levels in cellular Health with nishido time plus is a long-term strategy for aging well we recommend that you take the capsules with food we advise taking the first three capsules with the first meal that you have in the day and the second three capsules with your second meal although you can actually adjust this to fit with your own eaten schedule so if you're fasting you can actually take um all of the tablets in one go and it won't affect the efficacy we also just recommend checking with the doctor before starting any supplements and and also just avoid to take in any of the supplements that have high doses of the same ingredients [Music] [Music] [Music] oh [Music]
