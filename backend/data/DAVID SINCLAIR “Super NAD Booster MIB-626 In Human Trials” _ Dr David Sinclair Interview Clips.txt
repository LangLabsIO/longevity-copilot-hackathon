so [Music] this but what i'm working on which is not talked about a lot because it's it's in the commercial realm is there's been a team of seven chemists working on much better molecules than any of these two that i'm talking about um super nad boosters and we have ones that work far better than a man and these are timed release these are what we call pro drugs and uh those are the ones that i'm really excited about for medicines of the future that don't just increase someone's endurance but could actually treat diabetes and heart disease and cancer and alzheimer's that said we are doing a clinical trial right now with a molecule called mib626 mib is just metrobiotech and that's a couple of clinical trials that have been done at brigham and women's hospital in boston um separate group for me it's all independent uh and they that's just a safety study so uh when i come back on your show if i come back back on your show i may be able to tell you if we see some actual efficacy some results we're going to be looking in the phase 2 study at strength and endurance in the in the muscle of people after some nmn dosing so we're on on the verge of knowing if this is real or not for people about nad and interestingly i've been working with the team in boston on making an nad precursor a drug and so for the last two years with the help of a great team at brigham and women's hospital they've been testing the safety and efficacy of an nad precursor called mib-626 which is a proprietary version of an nad booster is that so far the molecule is extremely safe in the people that have been tested it's able to greatly raise nad levels now there's just some debate out there in the twitterverse that the molecules that we work on in my lab and at uh in these clinical trials don't raise nad and are not effective well i can tell you that you probably shouldn't get your scientific information from twitter because it's completely wrong and now what's interesting and exciting is that in the next few weeks very extensive double-blind placebo-controlled study is about to begin with this molecule and we'll see pretty quickly i think whether patients are helped by raising an ad particularly the the more severe ones now there are anecdotal case studies already some of them are online that you can look up if you're interested of patients recovering quite rapidly supposedly with treatment with nad boosters like nmn which is one of the ones that we work on but those individual case studies don't prove anything as we now know from you know having studied other molecules and other people study molecules in the world for cover 19. so that's why we've decided to do this very rigorous placebo-controlled study and not just go for compassionate use and we'll see over the next few weeks perhaps few months realistically whether this molecule that we're working on is going to dampen the inflammatory response in patients that really need it you know drugs are very hard to make most of them don't work so i'm i'm not promising anything i'm not expecting too much but i think that we need to give this a shot and the other reason for believing in this work is that aging as i started out in this review and this talk uh mentioning we think aging is the major driver of covert 19 susceptibility aging of all of the different parts of the body in particular the immune and circulatory systems now if we can delay aging or reverse it perhaps in some way with nad boosting or with other drugs that are out there such as metformin which nearby isolates arguing could be used to bring down blood sugar to improve the body's survival these kind of longevity molecules could be used to bring not just the virus down but boost the survival and the resilience and the defenses of the host up in the same way that you don't just have weapons of war you have defenses as well and so on the defensive side i think bringing up the defenses of the aged is just as valid if not more important than attacking the virus itself so why would i say it's just as important or more important well consider that this is not the only virus that's going to attack humanity going forward and vaccines while they're great and we hold out for one it probably won't work against the next outbreak whether it's bird flu regular flu or another coronavirus or even a mutated version of this one that's out in the population so we need to work also on the body's ability to fight infections in general [Music] [Applause] you
