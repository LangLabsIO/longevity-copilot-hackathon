[Music] but our question is are there more practical interventions we're obviously not going to be parabiotically carrying humans that would restore youthful function to old cells and this this circles back to again the main topic of today which is exercise this is a this is a slide from a an nih program called motor pack which is the molecular transducers of physical activity which asks this fundamental question that dan raised and then i'll that i am talking about which is why does exercise do this i mean what do we what is it that happens when we exercise that reduces our susceptibility to all these diseases whether it's lung cancer or diabetes heart attack cardiovascular disease bone health muscle health brain health i mean all of these are well known but really have little idea at this point on what the real molecular transducers are of physical activities and and this is actually dan referred to this so this idea that muscle does not only um move our body move our joints but it's actually a secretory organ so muscle secretes things and it secretes things locally and it secretes things into the blood these so-called myokines that dan mentioned that are these positive regulators of metabolism but they have positive effects on fat on liver on on pancreas on bone and so the question really is are these myokines are what's secreted by muscle are these the mediators and the more we exercise the more positive things are secreted from our muscle both locally and then into our blood um that might be mediating these beneficial effects so i want to just talk about how um the evidence we have that these might be acting on stem cells and some of the first evidence of this actually came from rusty gage's lab at the salk institute in which they they found that exercise just in the form of wheel running had this profound effect on stem cells in the brain so called neural stem cells leading to so-called enhanced neurogenesis the forming of formation of new neurons and these are neurostem cells in the area of the brain that are important for learning and memory and it was clear that that exercise can stimulate these neural stem cells and this enhancement of learning and memory as perhaps one of the most profound things you can do to enhance brain stimulation and neurogenesis so a few years ago we asked the question does exercise actually rejuvenate old muscle stem cells so the way we did this experiment is we put mice on one of these running wheels and we exercised them for a few weeks and then we again looked at their muscle injury responses and this is work done by a former md phd student lab jimmy brett and a current postdoc in the lab marina arjona and what we found was really quite striking so again mice run for run on a running wheel for three weeks and then we injure the muscle and we measure on the y-axis here is just an index of the regeneration so how well the muscles regenerate in young versus old mice what was interesting is we then had some mice not exercising some mice exercise exercise had very little effect on the young mice in terms of this muscle regeneration but in the old mice which have an impaired regeneration compared to young exercise almost restored uh this regeneration back to a young level so in a way similar to what we saw with the peribiotic experiments so clearly exercise was having this impact on this repair and we looked at actually the muscle stem cells and we asked what are the genes that are turned on in these old stem cells in response to exercise and this is just a complicated plot looking at lots and lots of genes but what you see high up here the gene that was the most highly induced in response to exercise is this gene cyclin d1 which is a very famous gene in terms of regulating cell proliferation and so-called cell cycle so we ended up doing a lot of experiments which i won't go into in which we either reduce the levels of cyclin d1 and we show that that impaired the ability of exercise to enhance muscle repair so clearly this gene its induction is important for this exercise response and equally importantly if we maintain cyclone d1 levels high in old muscle stem cells we could enhance the repair of muscle in the old animals so clearly cyclone d1 is playing a pivotal role in the stem cell population and in response to exercise so this is just our kind of working model of how how this looks so here you have young mice and old mice and we look at their muscle stem cells um from the from these hind muscles cycling d1 levels go down with age and with that decline you see an impairment of this regenerative response but with exercise you can induce even in the old animals this cycling d1 back up to a more youthful level and and you can get important improve regeneration so what we don't know is if this is the same pathway that works in other stem cells but this is what we're interested in studying and how this is regulated and again if there are factors in the blood that can be identified that can lead to this response they could potentially be turned in some some kind of therapeutic not the exercise pill as dan said but at least therapeutics that could potentially enhance different aspects of of stem cell function that change with age so i'm just gonna end with with two more interesting pieces of data from these studies and the first is something that will be familiar to anyone who trains and then stops training and that is the effective exercise is transient um we run these mice on a wheel for three weeks and again we're looking here at kind of a stem cell function immediately after three weeks of exercise that function is improved then of course in one week two weeks as we all know that benefit declines and so once you stop training you know that your your fitness goes down fairly quickly and goes back down to baseline so so that's no surprise but the the molecular pathways and the cellular class pathways kind of parallel what we notice happen physiologically and then the last piece of data i want to share is if we took old mice and we transfused them with blood either from another old mouse that had not exercised or from an old mouse that had exercised we asked what does the effect of those plasma transfers have on stem cell function and what we found this is just shown here on the graph on the right is that the effects of transfer of plasma from non-exercised mice is much less compared to the exercise mice so this just says that there actually is something in the blood of mice that exercise that can be transferred by a blood transfusion into another animal to produce the benefit of that exercise just confirming or or supporting the idea that there are factors in the blood that are mediating this beneficial effect that potentially could be identified and could potentially be um translating to some kind of therapeutic okay so let me just end by again talking about this idea of aging as a this is the function of youth of course and um can it be reversible can it be reversed is aging reversible we know that aging is malleable in the sense that we can slow aging we can delay the processes that change but from this kind of data as well as other data from other kinds of experiments there's increasing interest in the idea that at least aspects of the aging of cells and tissues can be reversed at least at least transiently and i think from a point of view of therapeutics one can really imagine that being translated into tissue repair so the time of a bone fracture or the time of a skin wound could you introduce some kind of therapeutic in this way that could restore youthful function to the older stem cells to enhance the repair at least of that tissue during that time so i think that's that's where we think of this beginning and then extending that more to longer term treatments in terms of um delaying the onset of age-related diseases [Music] you
