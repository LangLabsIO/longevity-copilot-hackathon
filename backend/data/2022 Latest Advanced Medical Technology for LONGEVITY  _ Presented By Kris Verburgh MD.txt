[Music] this because preventive medicine is not just about diagnostic tests but also about creating specific devices that can help doctors and patients to much sooner detect problems and diseases for example small phone can be used to analyze your voice to predict your risk of heart disease parkinson's disease depression or imagine you fall you feel to start sick and you start to cough so your smartphone could analyze the sound of your cuff and determine whether this cult is caused by asthma or bronchitis or pneumonia and so on there are also other companies working on you making use of your camera in your smartphone your selfie camera for example um that could track your eye movements to predict your risk of cognitive decline and there are also companies that looking into for example using ai to track your swiping behavior to also diagnose psychiatric disorders or dementia scopes that can use ai to analyze your heart rhythm for example is acg uh results or your heart murmurs to diagnose specific problems in the heart um we also invested in exo which creates a handheld ultrasound devices um and uh there is also this application of ai that can analyze these ultrasound images to diagnose specific diseases and of course this plays into this revolution or evolution that we are seeing like not until so long ago an ultrasound device was a very bulky device that you had to roll around and that cost between twenty and two hundred thousand dollars then you have companies like exo creating these hands-held ultrasound devices and we will go to a future where patients just stick it on their body like a patch or where it's integrated in clothing or in your smartwatch or bracelets and so on and that's of course very interesting because you can then track your health at home and this evolution will also enable much better preventive medicine and continuous more personalized medicine then of course besides these technologies another example of technologies we invest in our organ and tissue regeneration an example is cigalum that's encapsulating specific cells so that they are protected from the immune system and then the cells are and capsules are injected in the abdominal cavity where they can stay for six months or longer we also invested in companies like like genesis that are injecting liver cells into lymph nodes to grow livers inside those lymph nodes uh so you have like an extra organ and these liver cells know when to stop growing uh when they sense that the blood is filtered and cleansed enough which could be very interesting um to postpone the need for liver transplantations um all together even and this plays into this development where organs are grown for example in bioreactors or ideally in humans or even animals like some other companies are also doing so we have like a bit of two approaches towards this new biotech and longevity revolution you have people who are very optimistic and i think that these new technologies will enable us to live much much longer than what would be the biological plateau of our species which would be around 120 years but if we could uh partially reverse aging or substantially slow down the aging process we could perhaps push through that plateau of 120 years and under our scientists with more subdued visions uh saying that well it's just great that the paradigm shift is unfolding in the sense that the best way to keep people healthy is by targeting aging itself and i would be like as a medical doctor be very happy if the second quote would come to fruition already so that we in fact can keep people healthier for longer by going at the root cause aging itself [Music] [Applause] you
