[Music] the the book is basically trying to tackle this question universe is 138 13.8 billion years old roughly it's always changing Earth is 4.5 billion years old we're now an evolution you know created us we created artificial intelligence so intelligence has created intelligence we're baby steps away from Super intelligence and so what the book is trying to address is what do we do now Basics you and I today did several things to not die we looked before we crossed the street we threw out moldy food we changed a battery in the smoke detector we wore a seat belt you and I both tried to not die now like maybe someone does those things and they're smoking a cigarette so there's like some conflict right in our don't die understanding but we just don't want to die right now we're okay dying sometime in the future but what I've tried to do with with the blueprint is I've tried to become best-in world at not dying I've tried to say what if you measure as many biochemical reactions in the in your body as possible and figure out every single way your body's dying every day and how do you stop that process from happening and we get better and better and better and better and better the future is just basically getting better at what we already do we already have agreed upon in society we don't want to die so it's a very natural continuation of a game we all play this is where I started having dinners at my house uh I'd call them the first supper I'd get you know a few 10 or 12 people of my favorite people in the world and I would pose a thought experiment and I'd say imagine that you had access to an algorithm that could achieve for you near perfect health like you best in health mentally spiritually physically all the above and you could say yes to the algorithm the trade-off was you would need to do what the algorithm told you to so eat what it told you to do go to bed when it told you what to do so you're following the algorithm would you say yes to the to the op the opin and in that conversation you know a third of the people would say yes anything to save me from myself a third of the people would would would say well yes but I want to make a few changes it's like no LOL that's not the thought experiment and then half of the people or I guess the remaining people would be so offended about the idea that that somehow their free will or agency or whatever they perceived themselves to be was the ultimate manifestation of their existence and anything that challenge it they would just be so offended they would even know what to do and then for two and a half hours as a group we would debate the discussion you know like what does it mean to be human what does it mean to make decisions what does it mean to be able to actively do things that shorten One Life what does it mean to be you know 20 years old now and to be making decisions that affect your 60-year old self who gets decision power which one of you and so in those conversations people would have existential crisises you'd be like I don't know why I exist anymore I don't understand my reality they'd pop back up and they okay I've reconciled with that thing now I'm under my next and so it was basically trying to capture the essence of a group of friends getting together to try to reconcile with each other what does it mean to be human right now and what does it mean to be human in 10 years from now and how emotionally processed all the complicated questions we're up against and so the book is basically that told through characters of myself and I tried to basically make the debate so vigorous that you hear from one character you're like yeah good points and you hear from the next character like actually no I really agree with that guy but really try to swing it really hard on the different sides of the arguments there'll be a printed version you can buy from Amazon hopefully the the uh electronic version will continue to be free and then I'll have a recorded version I'm currently trying to assess whether I will read it or whether I'll get some actors too um but yeah I mean I'm hoping that it lands in the way that it's an understandable Zai shift uh you know I don't know I wrote the book in kind of a vacuum um it was based upon my life experiences but I have gotten you I get a few dozen emails every day of people who read it and they email me and they tell me their thoughts so uh I really I'm hopeful that it can hit but you'll [Music] see a
