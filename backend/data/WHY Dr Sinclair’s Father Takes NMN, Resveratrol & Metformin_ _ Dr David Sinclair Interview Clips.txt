[Music] full disclaimer here this again is not a clinical trial and it's not going to be published in a journal anytime soon but my family are a bunch of scientists my wife's a scientist from mit my father's a biochemist and we can read scientific papers my father believe it or not at age 80 is an independent individual and he has chosen to to take my research uh seriously and has been convinced by himself not by me uh to try things because he knows what the odds are in his old age of things going wrong by age 80 most people have at least two or three uh major diseases that are being treated um he started taking resveratrol early uh one of the first people in the world uh this is now going back 13 years ago and so far so good he takes a gram or so a day and the reason i say also is we in my family have powder we just spoon it into yogurt and mix it around it's important to dissolve it in something for it to be absorbed we know that from human studies and just to to dwell on resveratrol for a little bit um people go back and forth on resveratrol i can tell you in my lab we've we've definitely proven how it works i had a science paper that that was very positive and showed that it's working through the the two and pathway that we work on and we have new results that really nail it you know i don't i very rarely say we proved anything but this experiment that we've done has proven that it works the way we said it did but also what's it really encouraging is that there are human studies that are now showing that resveratrol does many of the things that we saw in mice many years ago protects people from high high fat diet and reduces blood sugar levels uh which is is great you know part of the reason that there were there were negative results i think in people is that though the researchers didn't realize that you need to dissolve resveratrol into something that allows it to be absorbed and when you do that you get five-fold higher levels in the blood um so getting back to my father uh he's been already virtual he's now on metformin he's been on metformin for probably six years now because he had high blood sugar everyone in my family uh dies early from diabetes related uh complications or heart disease and he's now the longest lived person in our family at least in on the male side uh and then he started adding nmn which is an nad boosting molecule the same one i take and those are the main things now if people want to learn exactly what we do and it's a long list uh page 304 you can skip to that in my book anyway i'll just finish to say that my father's no illnesses he has no aches or pains he's got as much energy as he did when he was in his 20s and 30s and mentally and physically he he can outpace me um and so yeah so far so good he's a big kind of hope for all of us i don't know if these pills are going to make me live a lot longer so far my father and i are not dead so that's good right and our blood biochemistry looks great so you know we we do this under doctor supervision it's not just random stuff and i wouldn't ever talk about it unless i knew a lot more about it than the average person um but it's not a substitute for a healthy lifestyle by any means and that's the reason i i do these these other healthy things and one of the best bits of evidence i can give you is that we we treat a lot of mice in my lab to make them live longer and or or healthier or stronger or fitter and what we see is that if we combine resveratrol with restricted feeding or if we combine nmn with exercise we get a greater benefit than either of those things alone [Music] you
