[Music] so as i as i wrote in my book lifespan there are eight recognized causes of aging from the loss of the ends of chromosomes the telomeres you mentioned autophagy chewing up all proteins um there's mitochondrial and energy production deficits over time so that there's there's i draw it like this because it's drawn typically by scientists as a pie chart with different pieces and we make the pieces equal right just i think because of politics you know the telomeres have the same slice of the pizza as do mitochondrial deficits autophagy metabolic changes stem cells and the part that i i actually work on all of those pieces but the part that my research has led me to believe that the big piece of the pie perhaps the largest piece and overruling of a writing piece is epigenetic changes and that basically means that it's the control systems that turn the genes on and off goes awry and our cells lose their identity they start misbehaving they have the wrong genes turned on and they screw up and they cause disease now the debate in the field right now is what's the relative size of those pieces of the pie or the pizza and i've come out pretty publicly including in the book and in scientific papers saying epigenetic change that clock that we can measure as changes in the dna chemical changes on the dna is the main cause of aging and everything else flows from that um and if you boil it down it's just a loss of information over time that leads to dysregulation of the genes in the body now that's that's bold um and i i like to do that because like you say scientific progress moves forward with bold statements and and criticism and debate um but i would say that's that's still the jury's out whether that's true whether my information theory of aging is true um and you know there's a lot of people who say well it's just part of the story and it doesn't explain this or that so that's a big debate um another question that we're all trying to figure out in the context of that theory is um how far can you turn back the clock by resetting the epigenome and we showed as earlier i mentioned it's possible to do that to reset the age of an animal or the eye or even human mini brains but the question there is how far can you go back and is it is it safe will it make this the cells so young that they become cancerous uh and then another question is how many times can you reset the body is it once or uh or is 100 times and so those are the questions that were we're debating and experimenting to answer the question that i can answer pretty well right now after a year of experimentation since we published is the safety issue and another company that i spun out of the lab uh is called life biosciences and it's working towards reprogramming the eye of patients to restore their vision and they've done a lot of safety studies in animals now they're now doing some primate safety studies and we don't see any evidence of cells becoming so young that they become cancerous which is remarkable because you'd think that resetting the body you could push it and it would just go too far but there seems to be this barrier in the body to going back too young you can go back to from 70 to 20 the equivalent of that in human cultured cells or mice but it stops and doesn't go further and and i debate people on that that they're really skeptical that because it sounds too good to be true that you could actually do that and we've been lucky enough to be able to do that safely [Music] you
