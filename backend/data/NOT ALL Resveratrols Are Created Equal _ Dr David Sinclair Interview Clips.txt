[Music] a question somebody said they have gi issues with resveratrol and it's actually a problem when when manufacturers pull out resveratrol from polygon and casper data which is not weed uh usually from china there's another molecule that causes gastric problems that comes along with it and so if you experience any gastric problems switch manufacturer look for a company that has what's called gmp good manufacturing practices and try to go with a company that is reputable and has been around for a number of years and uh so yeah that can happen it's called uh i think is is the chemical that comes across with it so yeah just be aware that you're getting super pure supplements that's part of the problem with the industry that it's not well regulated and if there's any discomfort yes which brands and that's even true for medicines in the case of metformin my metformin has giving me discomfort so i switched to a compound farms compound pharmacy that made it fresh for me and it's been much better yeah much much better um i think you'd mention in other talks before the color of the supplements resveratrol is often contaminated even if it looks pure so it should be light gray and powdery or white but even still it can be contaminated the worst ones are the ones that come out brown that resveratrol chemical chemically is not brown and that's true also for other supplements um i try to look for them later the color that they should be so for instance if you go to google or some other search engine and you type in a chemical let's say physique okay it'll tell you what color it should be it might say yellow or bright orange yeah it does so you should know that because if the capsule comes and it's filled with brown gunk throw it away so do your homework you guys it's not just what dr sinclair says it's also what google says so do your homework it tells you what the color is um and nmn and nad are should be pure white mm-hmm oh there's another thing i'm often asked how should people store these molecules so resveratrol i've kept for 10 years at room temperature but it has to be kept in the dark um for a week it'll be fine but no longer than that so i store things in my basement actually [Music] [Music] you
