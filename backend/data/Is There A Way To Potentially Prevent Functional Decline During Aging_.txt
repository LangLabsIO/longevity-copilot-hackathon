[Music] foreign so what uh do we already a little bit do and especially GPS do that if you have a 60 year old that 60 year old is declining in the organ function the glucose is going up the the blood pressure is going up before actually we hit that boundary that cut off we defined super duper well that this is abnormal we try to prevent these individuals to cross the boundary and that's what we call prevention and then we say yes well done diabetes is delayed for another two years what we don't do is in the same 60 year old who is functioning very well to actually see if you would be your digital twin would you be even better if you ever ask yourself are you in the greatest shape you could be um I'm not I can tell you I test lots of clocks and whatever value they have but I am not but what I'm trying and I think realizing that maybe I'm not in the best shape and I have something to gain would also be very useful for the ones who are in the the best turtles or in their quintiles or whatever the best of the best you would say don't come to the GP don't use my time because I'm there for the sake so we don't dichotomize your not sick or you're sick but also look at yourself and can your body or your mind and your soul even be better and that's very new I would say in in medicine so that's in a 60 or 70 year old but what we absolutely not do and and it's my age group we are not looking in the 40s so you're already declining and you see that if I look at the mirror I think okay I have to go to the airport and get another cream with with bubbles and they say I feel better but it doesn't help so already at the age of 30 or 40 we really have to look at what could you eat your capacity and could you actually get that up that your slippery slope to dependency might be a little bit a little bit later and that is really what longevity medicine or it we will have a consensus meeting next week actually in Singapore what longevity medicine actually is but this is at least what I think longevity medicine is to really bring the best out of if that person wishes it out of that that body um and of course I said okay at the age of 20 to 30 maybe we should start even earlier so we do projects in in nus where we actually look at the health of the mothers before actually conception to optimize the health of the child so you can really think even more dramatically and um and and differently at a person's health because in the end we are a genetic composition with lots of epigenetics and as Mark mood Khan already said the environment is shaping us this is also not that I have to learn you that everything is going down from your 30s onwards in terms of of function but I only want to show you that we have lots of cohort data with beautiful data for example here the Dunedin study will have follow-up who actually showcase evidence-based that organ systems are going down I want every Layman to know that they know from the 26 onwards celebrating the 26th first a seventh birthday that very likely the t's are going down in in function and more careers Etc in that the blood pressure is going up I want this is a slide for healthcare professionals what we learned from the UK biobank and my academic talk on Wednesday I will talk a little bit more about it we can prepare Healthcare professionals and and organize care differently if we use the data well having the lens of aging on we just showed here that there is a sequence of diseases in healthy individuals so we can predict what's occurring which function is declining when which means that we can interconnect the general of the the Healthcare System we have at the moment a quite conservative one so we know that the sequence and we can standardize care and we can be proactive to prevent the next age-related diseases when the first already occurred this is most important and this is what I would like longevity Physicians of Medicine Physicians to know before stopping um what it in my view at least but also we have to learn we have as if already said we have Diagnostics and we have interventions we already have it's not like me in a memory Clinic taking an mmse not having any drug and anything to offer at this moment in time in the longevity medicine uh physician Clinic we have something to offer and that is individualized lifestyle choices and and changes we can already extend if you take the mean of a population the the health spend and the lifespan by a couple of years so what I really would like to see and many more talks next year that we are diagnosing something we are bringing that into the care for that individual we have these interventions like environmental changes very important what is the noise level while sleeping what kind of pillow do you have these these kind of discussions I have with my patients lifestyle choices supplements structs Etc and of course then the new drugs and that needs to go into a re-measurement to actually see if it if it worked out [Music]
