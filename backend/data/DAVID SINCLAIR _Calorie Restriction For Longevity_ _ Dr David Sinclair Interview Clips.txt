[Music] one of the most robust ways to extend lifespan in animals is caloric restriction it's essentially making animals or even insects and yeast cells hungrier for longer in their life so i'm gonna do this experiment um where we've got flies kept on a rich diet for about a month these flies kept on a dietary restricted diet for about a month um so they've been eating their food is less nutritious and i'll tap them and we will ask which flies move faster and you can see the flies in dietary section for about 30 days are way more active than the flies that have been on a rich diet the dietary restriction um has been shown to work in over like 30 different species that extends not only extends lifespan but will also delay age-related diseases now what we think is going on is that this diet triggers a defense response in the body it tells all the cells in the body to unite against a threat which essentially is a threat to survival if you're not eating as much as you should conversely if you sit in a chair all day or you're obese that actually shuts down the body's defenses it becomes more complacent and says ah there's no threat we've got plenty of energy let's just grow and reproduce my general advice is to eat in moderation you know to stop eating before you're completely full if you're restricting diet appropriately and not limited in you know specific nutrients you should feel more invigorated at least that's what we see in the in the lab now we know calorie restriction works by turning on these defenses so that means we can find molecules drugs of the future that will be able to turn on the body's defenses just in the same way that calorie restriction does in mice we've been very successful at giving molecules to them and their bodies behave as though they're calorie restricted they get the benefits they're healthy they live longer but they don't have to calorie restrict and that's the key we should be able to have a drug or injection for when anybody comes into a hospital and needs some help [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] you
