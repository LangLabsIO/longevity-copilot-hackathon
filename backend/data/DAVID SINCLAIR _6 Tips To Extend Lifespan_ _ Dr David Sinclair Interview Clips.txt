[Laughter] [Music] [Applause] [Applause] yeah so i just want to um talk a little bit about what we can do in our daily lives to give ourselves the maximum possible health in old age and we know that how we live our lives has has a big impact on us in fact most of our longevity and health 80 in fact is determined by our epi genome not by our dna and we can change our epigenome by how we live so what can you do now well if you're getting sufficient food if you're eating three regular meals a day breakfast lunch and dinner or even eating snacks in between we know that that's not going to give the best chance of longevity and certainly overeating will be even worse so what i do is i like to skip at least one meal a day um we have you know not enough food in our household and our meals tend to be large to begin with and i try not to snack um i like to have tea and coffee if i get a little bit hungry and you do get used to it now you may not want to skip breakfast you may want to skip lunch you may want to skip dinner it's different for for every individual i also just want to point out that if you're young if you're a teenager or in your 20s this probably isn't for you i'm talking more about people who are middle-aged who whose metabolism has slowed down and we certainly don't want to suggest malnutrition or starvation as any way to improve health that's the last thing that we want to uh to talk about or uh or hint that that could be helpful this is more about being um you know at least some part of the day a little bit hungry and we've you know we've known this for thousands of years how that this actually is helpful what we didn't realize was that what happens when you're hungry is that these longevity defenses these longevity factors that i'm describing to you and others get turned on if we sit around all day if we are always you know eating or not feeling hungry our bodies will relax and they won't fight aging so this is one way to turn on those defenses against aging do a bit of exercise lose your breath a few times a week if you can if you don't move get up walk at least um do do some weight lifting as well i once a week at least i try to lift something um i do some wrestling with our son as well that helps i talk about hip hinge exercise this is bending your hips and lifting weights it's very important to particularly keep your hips strong from walking and bending because uh just in the us every 19 seconds somebody falls over and breaks a bone and this is just as bad as getting cancer in terms of survival uh you might want to talk to your doctor and get tested to see what's what's working in your body and try to counteract that you can also have devices on your wrist that can tell you how you're doing and i do that because i mean not i don't take blood tests a lot but i do try to monitor to see how i'm doing to see if things are working sleep well reduce stress this is all important stuff sleep is actually intimately tied to these longevity genes that control the pace of aging and here's one you may not have heard uh you want to eat plants that have been stressed what i mean by that well red wine is an example of a food stuff that's made from grapes that have been stressed you will probably want to eat plants that have been grown outdoors or dehydrated and we actually farmers actually know that if you stress plants before picking such as orange trees you can put a nail into the stem and it will produce better fruit the reason is that plants produce their own molecules to improve survival and longevity and we believe and we've got a lot of evidence that when you eat those molecules from the food you mimic exercise and you mimic fasting and hunger we call this zero hormesis [Music] you
