so [Music] honey dr shin ichiro amay at washington university school of medicine in st louis is investigating an aging intervention treatment based on a natural compound called nmn nicotinamide mononucleotide years ago dr amay was first to prove the success of nmn in mice as it worked safely to slow down signs of aging as well as boost energy and rejuvenate metabolism there are a wide variety of anti-aging effects on tissue functions and we need to figure out how many and how much can be really translated to humans in order to investigate safety and efficacy in humans amay teamed up with dr samuel klein director of the center for human nutrition at the school of medicine the team created a small human clinical trial with 25 post-menopausal women who had pre-diabetes in this study we particularly selected participants who are post-menopausal women with pre-diabetes because studies in rodents have shown that female mice have a better response to nmn therapy than do male mice in addition people with pre-diabetes have some significant metabolic abnormalities that could potentially be ameliorated by treatment with nmn as shown in rodent models and so this particular group we thought was ideal to test the potential metabolic benefits of nmn therapy in the first randomized clinical trial in people this was a double-blind randomized control trial in which the participants received either placebo therapy or 250 milligrams of nmn daily for 10 weeks and were studied before and after the intervention from the study they discovered nmn improves muscle glucose metabolism improved insulin sensitivity and muscle in our participants and what that means is that improve the ability of insulin to stimulate glucose uptake in muscle tissue a defect in insulin action and muscle is an important metabolic complication that's associated with obesity that's involved in causing pre-diabetes and type 2 diabetes klein says it's encouraging how nmn improves the ability of insulin to increase glucose uptake in skeletal muscles the ability of muscle to respond to insulin by enhancing its glucose uptake could improve glycemic control meaning improving the control of blood sugar in the body this is one early study and so these early findings support that potential concept of nmn improving blood glucose control but we really need more and more definitive studies in the future to fully evaluate this potential ongoing research exploring anti-aging benefits of nmn is now supported by a 3.8 million dollar grant from the u.s department of defense dr amay says the team has increased the nmn dosage and duration for a second clinical trial of 60 people 30 men and 30 women between the ages of 50 and 75. a little bit higher dose and a little bit longer duration what happens to people and that's exactly what we are now assessing in the second clinical study ami says the findings from the first clinical trial give him reason to believe that nmn may one day offer clinical benefits to boost what he calls productive aging if our second clinical trial suggests like a more um beneficial defects of a man in humans then maybe uh it might be an interesting idea to take in a man for longer time and see what happens to our metabolism and particularly in old individuals the idea is to increase quality of life as people get older by providing aging intervention we cannot make any clinical recommendations for people and so this is like many things we really need more studies in human subjects to identify the potential of nmn as a therapeutic agent uh both improving health energy metabolic function and longevity and time will tell [Music] [Music] you
