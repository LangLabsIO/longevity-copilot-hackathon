[Music] foreign so in terms of longevity supplements they are mostly designed to replace the molecules in your body they are responsible for your good health in your youth the vast majority of these are impossible to get from other sources such as food so we must supplement in order to stay in Peak health good stable ingredients like the ones you get from do notage.org are absolutely fine in room temperature so most people prefer to start with ingredients that have the most impact on how they feel which would mean that you're going to want to take certain sex activator followed by nmn and then finally collagen peptides cert6 is the most important because it's a protein that does a lot of the repair work in your body it's very active when you're young but as your age it becomes less and less active so your body doesn't repair as well which is why we then see aging people that are over 100 years old and are still active and healthy have very high levels of Sussex but ultimately most people aren't like that because those people have a specific Gene it's sometimes pronounced sir T6 we use cert six for ease the cert6 activator ingredient from do not age.org is the first and only verified activator of cert6 so I chose nmn as second best because increasing your NAD level is also very important it's and it is responsible for over 400 processes in the cell over time you lose your NAD do not age.org is developed an NAD test kit this enables you to track your NAD levels over time to ensure that you're doing the right thing but what we've actually done is we've got loads of results in now and we can see that nobody over the age of 30 has an a healthy NAD level which for me is an epidemic of NAD levels so Enderman is a precursor to NAD it's proven to boost it it's got a lot of health benefits um and that's why I choose nmn thirdly I chose collagen peptides collagen's the main structural protein in the body responsible for tendons ligament skin hair joints and as ever as we get older our body doesn't create collagen as well as it once did so we lose the collagen in our body this means when you take collagen peptides people can feel and see the effects in their hair skin nails and joints that's my top three but ultimately anything you see on the Do Not age.org website has been tested in humans because we know that it helps your health and that's the reason people use it [Music]
