foreign so [Music] what are the what do we know about the interventions and are they different from what we already know so we know a mediterranean-style diet we're not eating a lot of red meat lots of different kind of vegetables with the natural chemicals that are in there like antioxidants and so on exercise which has a degree of intensity to it so that you know you're not just going for a casual walk with your friends you're actually stressing the body intermittent fasting of various kinds where you're stressing your metabolism those are the things that people say are good for your your general metabolism are those the things which seem to tie into a healthy epigenome they are that that's the amazing thing doctors and epidemiologists nutritionists who discovered that kind of foods and lifestyles that lead to a health healthy lifestyle a healthy life and also longevity such as the island of okinawa or the mediterranean diet they discovered these things independently from us who are working on genes and enzymes but what we've discovered is that the molecules in those foods and those types of exercise turn on these longevity genes there's sort of but there's others there's one called mtor that responds to the amino acids and protein that we eat there's one called ampk which responds how much energy our cells have and how much sugar is in our body and so in other words what we've learned so far is that these types of diets and exercise in it i would say inadvertently but but not coincidentally are turning on these genetic pathways but what's important is that now that we know that we can make medicines that are 100 times more powerful than you could ever get from a treadmill and not only that you cannot expect an elderly person to go running on a treadmill for 10 minutes a day what we need is an iv or a pill that we can give them to revive them so what do you do for you in your own life apart from those things that um you've discovered that's a handy tip for in other words that you've learned that you're trying out for yourself and not just your resveratrol from red wine i mean what what are you in terms of your behavior your lifestyle yeah well i've been become a little bit of a a role model here not really intentionally i'm just a scientist trying to do the right thing uh but the older i get i find that the more interested i am in my own research but so i'm i've just turned 50 my father's 80 we're both on a very similar program uh we monitor what we do very carefully with with uh rings like this um and and blood tests that you can get commercially at least over here in the us and we see what what works for us and what doesn't so we're not just blindly experimenting but we are trying to see if see what happens um in a very safe controlled way my father's also a scientist in sydney he can judge for himself um so yeah resveratrol i've been taking for 13 years what's that go on sorry yeah what's that oh so this is called an orange o-u-r-a kind of uh it'll tell me heart rate movement sleep patterns it's very useful for optimizing sleep that's one of the great things about it of course we've also got these devices now as well so my point is that if you just pop a pill or do some exercise and you don't measure yourself you're flying blind so [Music] sometimes i just i cut to the chase and i say i wrote down what we do in my family on page 304 of the book that i just put out but i'm not trying to sell books here i'm just trying to say if we don't have enough time to get through it people can go see what what we do in a list but it's a resveratrol uh i do nmn i take a bit of nmn which is an nad precursor that raises nad i'm taking more olive oil since it was just discovered that oleic acid activates one of the main sort of pathways just like resveratrol so that's good for us vitamin d is important and also i'm taking metformin which is a drug that is probably the the craziest and dangerous most dangerous idea that uh i'll bring up which is that there are drugs on the market like metformin for diabetes type 2 diabetes that have been shown in tens of thousands of people to slow down the rate of age-related diseases so not just diabetes but cancer heart disease alzheimer's and frailty but you need a doctor's prescription to get that in australia and the us [Music] [Applause] [Music] you
