[Music] so that's actually one of the main topics that we are heavily invested because you know to know why something doesn't work as you age we have spent a lot of years trying to understand how does it normally work you know if you want to fix something you have to know what is not working so you need to understand their functioning so something that we have learned with the years is that autophagy as you say malfunction with age in most cases as you point out there is a decrease in autophagy activity but sometimes what you lose is the ability to regulate it so basically there are particular conditions that you need to activate out of body a bit more to accommodate to any stress and that's what is lost with aging so you might still have some basal levels of cleaning but you cannot do the extra mile and that really depends on the cell type so different cell types get automatically affected at different times in life and also depends on the type of autophagy so to follow with the chaparral mediated autophagy theme in that case we know that it's always a decrease of function and it's very universal i mean we have not only in different cells in the body but going from mice to humans we can see this decrease on cma activity with age so that's one of the reasons why we are particularly interested in that pathway because intervention wise i think will be easier to tackle that pathway because it always changes in the same direction and it's quite universal i mean while other forms of autophagy have you know different variations it might be more at the regulatory level rather than the total activity and we are still investigating some of these other mechanisms but i think with cma with chaperone mediated autophagy we are getting closer to understand why it doesn't work so in the case of chaparral mediated autophagy again i mean i'm doing something that we should never do in science that is generalizing right always happen this way of exceptions but you know the common thing here is that the receptor so i mentioned that you have your chaperone the chaperone identified the protein that needs to be degraded and you bring it to the lysosomes and in the lysosome you kind of have a receptor kind of an antenna there that is where the chaperone docks and pass the protein inside so that particular antenna that is called lam2a and it's what decreased with age so what we have found is that as you get all normally you know like any other component inside the cell you have to renew also your lysosomes and this particular protein is normally renewed in a young person every three days so every three days you have a new lamb today and a new lysosome working what happened in aging is that this protein is lost in 10 hours so the rest of the time until you have the new wave of receptor you're not gonna have this receptor you're not gonna have this antenna and we are extremely interested right now in trying to understand why that protein cannot stay in the lysosomes and be functional longer when you get old and so far it seems like it's really related with the lipid composition of this membrane and we got into that and the first hint is because we realized that as i mentioned the levels of this receptor decreased with age and when i gave talks you can see the young people saying ah i have plenty of time right i'm very young but what i showed them is that if you put a mouse in a mcdonald's diet like high-fat diet these germ mouse in three months become as bad as a very very old mass regarding autophagy so basically nutrition and the amount of lipids that you have the amount of sugars are gonna modify your lysosomal environment so your receptor that was supposed to last for three days now it only lasts for like 10 hours because it's not in the right lysosomal environment and so far we've seen that the membrane composition is a big player on that [Music] you
