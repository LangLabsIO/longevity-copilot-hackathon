[Music] foreign so if you're if you're young and you lose your hair that's one thing versus you're old and you lose your hair versus losing the color of your hair it's all different pieces and parts of this puzzle um so if you are young and you're losing your hair it's probably genetic and then you're sort of semi-screwed if you're old and you're losing your hair and it's the male pattern balding it's a cross between hormonal issues blood flow in the scalp and a variety of other things because if you PRP the bald spot as you are balding you can actually recover a lot of the hair loss so we know it's reversible it's just a matter of what is it that we are reversing it doesn't need to be topical or can it be oral interestingly enough there's something called a clonea Cava which is a seaweed from Japan and it's known to make your hair grow faster and better um which is kind of cool how it does that exactly I don't know but it does and Studies have proven that it does um additionally so in terms of color color can be one of two things color comes from a melanocyte stem cells um how to phrase this one of two things either happened either the melanocyte stem cell stops making melanocytes and this for stops making color or the hair gets bleached from within because you get a development of catalase in your cells that's not true you get a development of hydrogen peroxide in your cells and catalase gets rid of it and turns it into oxygen and water but if you have a catalase deficiency you're going to bleach your hair before it grows out so you're going to look Gray so you're either gray because you've got stem cell problem or even catalase deficiency both of which you can kind of help by the entire program so a lot of the things I talk about and aren't going to be specifically for your hair but they're going to help all of your cells in general and therefore your hair will benefit by association I don't have a magical shampoo if that's what you're asking for a clonia Cava I I take it orally but it does come they put it in creams frequently then you can smear it on yourself I think there's actually a colonial copy of shampoo I think I've never used it I think I've seen it advertised but yes I guess there is a magic shampoo I don't know if it works or not I've never tried I have I have no firsthand evidence of that but I do take a colonial Kava and I do have damn good hair which may or may not be correlated I have no idea [Music]
