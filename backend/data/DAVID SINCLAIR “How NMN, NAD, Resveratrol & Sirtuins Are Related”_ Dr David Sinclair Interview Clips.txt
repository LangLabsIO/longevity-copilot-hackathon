[Music] so [Music] and nmn is a class of molecules called nad precursors i talk about them in my book extensively we've researched them for about a decade the way to think of these molecules is that they are the gas pedal for the the sirtuins that we work on so sirtuins are defensive enzymes against aging we have seven of them in our bodies so the the nad is the fuel uh the gas in the tank and the resveratrol is the accelerator pedal and they both work on the same system on the same proteins that defend the body and uh so that's why i think the combination might be helpful uh nmn is a molecule that is naturally occurring and the body converts it into this nad what's nad well nad is a molecule we need for life we have a lot of in our bodies and it's used for chemical reactions but it's also used by these sertuan defenses that we work on as an indicator of when times are tough when times are tough our bodies fight disease and aging and fight against uh or fight for longevity but without nad or high levels of nad they don't work very well and in fact the older we get in many of our tissues the levels of nad decline apparently by as much as 50 percent which i predict is is going to be a reason why we age faster and faster as we get older and why we are susceptible to diseases as we get older so the idea with with nmn is that we can raise those nad levels back up give the gas to the system that defends us and in mice at least we've shown in others uh that there are remarkable rejuvenation properties in elderly mice for example i mentioned alice in my lab and others have shown that you can make mice run 50 further by giving them nmnt in their water supply just for four weeks and that's all published if anyone wants to check it out uh it was in the journal cellar a couple years ago so that's nmn resveratrol is the molecule in red wine which we worked on for many years we still do a little bit of work on that trying to tease out the mind you share about how it's actually working in the body but we have a lot of really good evidence that one of the ways residual works is this accelerated pedal on these enzymes what do i do i still take resveratrol i've been doing that since 2004 i'm still healthy and alive so an n of one clinical trials been successful but there have been clinical trials with resveratrol some have shown no effect some have shown positive effects on things like uh endurance and blood sugar levels and all trials are done different ways of course sometimes the patients are older sometimes they have obesity um and in and sometimes resveratrol is given with food without food um and residual tends to work in clinical trials when it's given to people who are older might have a bit of excess body fat and also when it's mixed with food that that helps it dissolve because resveratrol is like eating brick dust it doesn't dissolve very well and can just pass straight through the body mix it into your yogurt that's what i do yeah so i did that today uh you know just to to prove that i'm i'm not making this up uh i have yogurt i i like to use greek yogurt because i find it dissolves very well in that but because i'm trying not to eat until late lunch or dinner it's just a couple of spoonfuls to be able to get the resveratrol into my system you mentioned nad boosters and we probably should should definitely get into that but um well they're central too because as i mentioned the proteins many of them like it's returned to a moving around controlling the epigenome you want to stabilize that as best you can animals like whales and naked mole rats have a very stable epigenome so this moving around of proteins and epigenomic noise accumulating if we're exercising we're taking nad boosters we do slow that process down i believe well let's talk about what nad boosters are so the precursors for nad we make nad in our bodies yeah we do uh and so nad is recycled in the body because there's grams of it you can't eat that much easily and there's a cycle it's called the salvage pathway of nad and it all starts with nicotinamide which is a form of nice and vitamin b3 but you can't just well you can but it's not very effective um just overdose on vitamin b3 because you need other things to make the big molecule nad so nad is the reason it's called nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide is it's got these three main components and the dinucleotide is related to dna right but that's beside the point it's a big molecule so that if you give a big molecule to cells it doesn't get taken up so we don't feed animals nad and we don't just feed them nicotinamide which is the little end part of nad because it's too it's too small in that you need these other parts so nmn and nr are two molecules so it stands for nicotinamide mononucleotide which is essentially uh the precursor the immediate precursor to nad if you give a cell nmn it will be taken up by a transporter which was just discovered by my buddy shinamai we used to work together at mit now he's at washu a few weeks ago he wrote about it i wrote about it that there's a transporter that sucks up nmn and the animan is converted within one step to nad in the cell and now it's locked it's a big molecule locked inside the cell and that step is carried out by an enzyme it's got a name it's called an mpt and that enzyme goes up under stress and calorie restriction and in yeast it's the same step and so we showed years ago that that step of conversion of nmn to nad or in yeast um what is it nicotinic acid to nad is the critical step for boosting nad when you're going through your circadian rhythms when you exercise when your cells are stressed and without that step you don't get the benefits of calorie restriction your organs start to get old so what is nr so nr is uh fairly popular a lot of people have heard of it it stands for nicotinamide riboside and all it is it's just a smaller version of nmn without a phosphate on there so there's no phosphorus on it um so if you take nr your body has to first put on a phosphorus and then it has to uh basically link two of them together to make the nad so with all that said nr gets converted into nmn first and then into nad yes yes it has to yeah um but nr and nmn have both been shown to raise the nad levels in animals um and in humans as well and there's small nuances about the differences but they both seem to be effective not just in humans actually and i should say in mice but in yeast they work as well which is nice [Music] [Music] [Applause] you
