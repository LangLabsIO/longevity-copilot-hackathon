[Music] most of my actually all of all of the things that i do are based on uh on the knowledge that it's extremely extremely unlikely that it's going to do any harm um i typically take molecules that have been in the body already for millions of years nmn has been in the body for billions of years and what we are doing by giving nmn is replacing what's lost with age um speaking most generally tissues decline in their nad production in a man being a precursor um by about 50 by the time you're my age and i i can raise those back up and we actually i actually know a lot more than the public thinks about the effects of nmn on the human body i've been helping do clinical trials for about three years now and we know it's safety to some extent we know how much it raises nad in the body in which tissues and we'll even have some efficacy results to tell you about next year uh in mice it extends their lifespan it appears we're doing more mice but it looks really good especially in females and it reduces um obesity improves lean mass improves their metabolic flexibility and delays their frailty which is based on 20 measures of health including hearing and eyesight so based on all of that i've had no issue with my father choosing to take it i couldn't stop him he's a grown man he's a scientist himself um but i don't have any concerns there is something on the internet unfortunately that like a lot of stuff on the internet that's just hype uh it's in the same realm as metformin prevents you from building muscle this one is that nmn will make your cancer grow more it comes from a study from washington university where they depleted nad from brain cancer cells and they grew slower and the pr department of washi put out a press release saying nad makes cancer cells grow well yeah right uh you know that's that's kind of a misreading of the data especially when you need nad for life so having less of it of course is going to make cancer cells grow slower but giving them more doesn't seem to do that in our hands we've tested it in a couple of cancer models you know in an abundance of caution if you had a tumor i wouldn't take nmns we don't know but if you're healthy right now there's no evidence that it should have any negative side effects the biggest side effect that we've seen anecdotally is in perimenopausal women it might um improve the health of the ovaries and put out more hormones they tend to have shorter menstrual cycles and and heavier ones um but other than that and that's consistent with our mouth studies showing you can reverse infertility in old mice but other than that i don't know of any downsides taking nmn and we haven't seen anything in the clinical trials either [Music] you
