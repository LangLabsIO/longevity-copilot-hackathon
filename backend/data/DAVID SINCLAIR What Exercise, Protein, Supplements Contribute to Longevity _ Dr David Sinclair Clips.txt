foreign [Music] so what is your perspective on movement exercise and how that fits in to your kind of theory and philosophy on aging yeah well probably for me to say don't walk and don't move that that's step one if you don't walk or move then you're in big trouble when you get older um so that's a minimum but if we're talking about what's what's not maximum but optimal we don't know that for sure and it might be everyone's different but in general losing your breath is important high intensity exercise you don't need a lot i just mentioned 10 minutes a few times a week that appears to be sufficient to give you the longer term health benefits and what's probably going on is in part is that we well we discovered and we published this in 2018 in the journal cell if anyone wants to look it up that old muscle starts to think that it doesn't have enough oxygen even though there is enough oxygen and it shuts itself down and doesn't make a lot of energy and the blood vessels start to be depleted and it's a just a terrible feedball process after that so by making your body hypoxic and giving it a stress both in the you can actually do excess oxygen or lack of oxygen just you just want to shock the system then your body gets to reset um and and one of the most popular things to do in the longevity world now is uh what is it high pressure bariatric oxygen therapy and that i think is also resetting this uh this problem that our bodies have where they are what we call pseudo hypoxic one of the ways that we could reset that without exercise and without high pressure oxygen chambers was using nmn this molecule that i take it actually boosted the body's ability to make new blood vessels that restored the the ability to measure oxygen in the muscle um and when we gave it to mice they could run 50 further without having trained but the good news is well you know the important point is that the mice that were young and exercised and got the molecule in their water ran twice as far so it's it shouldn't be an excuse to pop a pill and not do anything but there are some little changes you can make i lift weights i have them around my house i i'm at a standing desk which goes up and down here these are changes that i make that um i'm standing most of the day now and this will really help it builds the muscles in your leg and your butt and your back that's important now especially for a male my age where i'm losing one percent muscle if i don't do something about it every year but also the hormones testosterone comes from having those large muscles uh signal to the testes and i've been able to correct and raise my testosterone levels just by keeping those large muscles in shape so much to dive into that it's incredibly fascinating that potentially to get these longevity benefits that you're talking just maybe 10 minutes of this kind of pulsed exercise where we're out of breath so high intensity interval training several times a week which is very achievable even for the busiest person out there so i i find recommendations like that really really inspiring because you know eating less exercising 10 minutes several times a week you know a lot of people think health and wellness is the preserve of the wealthy the middle class all kinds of things like that and i know there are certain things which do cost money but it's also refreshing to know that there are lots of things that actually can be done completely free of charge you know eating less is actually saving you money right then uh been eating three meals today but you know there's a couple of points around exercise which i really want to dive into one of them is as you say at your age you're losing one percent muscle mass uh each year uh if you don't do something about it i think that starts at the age of 30 for most of us so what's when i think about that and i think about mtor and protein i had this like clash in my head whereby we know that sarcopenia this loss of muscle mass is a problem as one gets older uh risk of falling problems after that all kinds of things happen when we lose that muscle mass so a lot of the recommendations around fighting sarcopenia are to do with yes resistance training but also the amount of protein you are consuming to make sure you're limiting how much that happens yet at the same time we're sort of suggesting that to increase our aging we should be limiting our protein intake help me help us see through that apparent contradiction well yeah i'm not saying limit protein intake at all i get plenty of protein um just mostly from plant-based sources where there's not a lot of the branched chain amino acids those leucine isoleucine valine amino acids are the ones that activate mtor um and so yeah focus on plants you'll have enough protein to build muscle i have no no trouble building muscle um that that it's a fallacy that you need to be eating you know these protein shakes and meat you get stronger and to build muscle now if you want to professionally build muscle by all means go for it but for most of us who just want to feel good look good live longer what i'm recommending doesn't affect your ability to do those things and and build up muscle one bit and there's it's also a fallacy that older people cannot build up muscle my father who's 82 has built up a lot of muscle he goes to the gym twice a week he runs he hikes and he literally is stronger than me um and he says he hasn't felt this good since he was in his 30s though he does say that he probably felt like crap when he was 30. even then even if he did feel like crack when he's in his 30s that's a pretty powerful thought isn't it that someone in their 80s can be quite confident in saying doesn't matter how i felt my face i'm feeling better on my 80s and my 30s that is that's incredible right it's it's not something to be sniffed at that is something that is not the norm in society it's not what people expect people think it's an inevitability that we're going to get slower more tired our memory's going to go and i don't buy that first of all i've seen that there are many things we can do to mean that's not an inevitability but i think you take it that you take it even further and and you're showing very clearly that that does not have to happen to everyone it's exactly right i'm not going to say my father and i are a clinical trial um in fact we were just doing this mainly because we're scientists we can read the literature we're researching it um but it's a fun experiment right we've now been doing this long enough that something weird is going on my dad feels like and acts like he's 30 and i don't act or hopefully you can judge look like i'm 52. he's 82. so that's pretty interesting we'll see over the next 10 20 years what happens but he he's not a special person when it comes to life he he's an average guy he didn't like exercise he was not looking forward to the future uh he's not obsessed with his health at all and look at what happened you know he's living a life that he didn't expect at all and we're already planning going to africa after covert he's looking at life over the next 30 years i mean what 80 year old does that an eight-year-old whose son is david sinclair that's who maybe you mentioned uh well that that there's this theme isn't there always about this hormetic stress this pulsed stress on the body that you can then recover from i can see how interval training does that um what about other forms of training now as we have this conversation i am two and a half weeks away from doing my very first marathon so i i'm gonna be running the london marathon in two and a half weeks when this conversation comes out hopefully i will have completed it i am not doing this for longevity to be really clear i'm doing it for other reasons it's something it was a challenge that was set to me i'm enjoying the process of seeing if i can do it but it's an interesting question since i have you on you know clearly running a marathon and i'm not an endura you know typically i've not been an endurance type guy so i've not done lots of stuff like this at all this is well outside my comfort zone could this be a stressor on my body that has a powerful effect when it comes to what my body then does with respect to thinking it needs to hunker down of course it's going to be highly uh individual based or could it be that it's too much of a stress you've gone past that hormetic sweet spot and it's gone into the realm of actually depending on my fitness levels and and how it fits into the rest of my life that it can actually become problematic i'm not worried about you if you look at the marathon runners uh there's a very clear uh correlation with longevity people who bike or run long distances uh do live longer in fact in the case of cycling if you do i think it was 80 miles a week your risk of heart attack goes down uh 60 a massive amount i don't know about marathons but um i i think that you'll be fine based on all the evidence yeah so um and then you mentioned with we've not spoken really in detail about elementary and i would like to but you did mention when the them the mines took it their endurance got better and and that that sort of uh rung a a kind of that really rang in my brain when you said it cause i thought oh i'm doing a marathon in a few weeks as well as its anti-aging ability does it also in your experience beyond that trial have an ability to improve and increase our endurance levels well we don't know in humans yet um there's been very few studies uh with nmn and endurance in fact i'm struggling to think of one now we're doing it myself um over at harvard and we'll know probably early next year if this is true but i do have an anecdote um one of my now good friends ken rideout is his name he was a middle-of-the-road marathon runner kind of doing it as a hobby and i met him a few years ago and he decided to to make it his mission to see if he could uh use my science to improve and every few months he got faster and faster and faster and he's now 50 years old and he's the world champion for his age and often just beats the 30 year old in marathons myrtle beach was the most recent he will be in the same marathon as you uh so look out for ken right out if he wins this race he's the official world fastest 50 year old in marathons oh wow he's on anime and resveratrol mainly and uh you know we don't have a twin as a negative control which is what we should have and it should be placebo-controlled but absent that it's pretty interesting what we've seen happen to you so let's go into these supplements we have of course we've covered food and exercise and how we can manipulate them to increase our longevity i do want to talk about cold exposure later on um but you've mentioned a few times that there are certain supplements that you take and other people are taking um so what if we could go through them sequentially and just sort of figure out what they are um i know you've got to be careful in terms of what you are recommending or not recommending but what does the science so far suggest from you know from from what you've seen well it's a long conversation um and i work with clients on on this because it's it had to be tailored to people's blood work and age and that kind of thing but in general what i do is listed on page 304 of my book so that's the cheat sheet of lifespan uh but they fall into buckets one is the plant polyphenol cocktail resveratrol corset and physique uh i mixed that in the morning this morning i had yogurt with it mixed in so you don't take them as uh as like a capsule you wouldn't just swallow as a capsule you want the powder mixed into something like olive oil so that it's absorbed better yes yeah but there's that and then there's nmn which i take a gram of every morning uh which is water-soluble i just swallow that down and then i take metformin at night um probably every other day and uh and those are the main things there's there's plenty of other things that work for me i believe um but that's a good start and i would start i'm not recommending anything of course i'm not a doctor but if i was to do it i would start slowly i would change just one or two things at a time and i would measure baseline before and after to see how you're doing because again you don't know what's happening unless you measure it um you can do inside tracker i think i'm not sure in the uk what the equivalent is but you can do inside tracker from the uk they let you upload your data for a small fee and that would allow you to see if something's going wrong or going right but also you can also show that data to your doctor i would recommend working closely with your doctor if you're starting to take some of this stuff even if they're just supplements i'm also working on trying to figure out how to approve or at least give education about which supplements work don't work might work which ones are pure which ones are filled with toxins this kind of thing needs to happen in the industry because every day i get asked by dozens of people tell me a brand that i can trust and i literally cannot because how would i know i'm not a nutraceutical guy i'm a scientist who works in a lab [Music]
