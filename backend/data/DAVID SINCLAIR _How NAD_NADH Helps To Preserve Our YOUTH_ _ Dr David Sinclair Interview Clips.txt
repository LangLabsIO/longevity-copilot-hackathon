[Music] okay let's start with the big kahuna which is nad nad is a chemical in the body we have a lot of it we have grams of it in our body and it's used for chemical reactions and without it we're dead in 30 seconds or less it's like taking cyanide you're dead nad moves hydrogen atoms from one chemical to another in the body actually called a hydrogen donor it's like a carrier and hydrogens are important they're just with carbons and hydrogens we can make a lot of molecules and so what nad is is used so an enzyme's a protein that makes other chemicals and so it might say hey i need a hydrogen for my favorite molecule that i'm going to build it's like building blocks and along comes nad but it'll carry an h to hydrogen and it's called nadh so nadh comes along it'll attach the enzyme the enzyme will say thank you very much for that hydrogen and you'll be moved on to the chemical of interest and off goes the new form of the chemical now that enzyme's very happy because now it's done what it's meant to do but actually doing that probably 5 000 times a second it's a really big fast reaction and then nad itself gets recycled and made back into nadh so it's a cycle but what we discovered um well some of us discovered i was just one of them is that nad itself isn't just used for these chemical reactions that was discovered over 100 years ago by some germans what it's actually also doing is the body uses it as a measure of adversity and when there's adversity not enough energy too much exercise or any exercise really hot cold it appears that nad levels uh will will increase in as a result and that is beneficial that turns on the body's defenses and so as we get older we lose nad we don't make as much and we degrade it in fact and so a 20 year old will have double the amounts of someone like me who's in their mid 30s maybe on a good day biologically i'm actually 52. but i i probably have if i didn't supplement with nmn i would have half the levels of 20 year old which is bad because now the sortuins the defense enzymes um and repair enzymes there's one called parp they don't work as well and we succumb to aging and there's another thing that that nad does and it protects uh and stores the information to be young and information is important for preserving our youth and the way genes are turned on and off is lost over time genes get dysregulated uh it's like a scratched compact disc if you remember what a compact disc is um and and nad levels tiny d levels preserve that information uh until we figure out a way to actually reset system and get those scratches off so that's nad but if to make nad you the cell uses nnn which is nicotinamide mononucleotide which you can buy as a supplement and then to make a cell makes nmn from nr and the cell makes nr from vitamin b3 so you can take any one of those and raise nad levels but what we've discovered in people in clinical trials is that the closer you get to the nad itself the better the boost in nad that you get but you can't take nad itself because it's a very big molecule and it doesn't get in through the membrane of the cells so nmn does that and what we will report but i'll tell you live now is that if you take or if we give a gram to our subjects human subjects for 10 days they will double their energy levels in their blood cells and in fact if you give two grams you triple it now so i take a gram a day to double my levels to get me back to being a 20 year old in the expectation and somewhat hope that my body is now defending itself against aging so [Music] you
