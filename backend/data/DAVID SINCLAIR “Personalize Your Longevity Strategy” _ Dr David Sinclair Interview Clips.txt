[Music] and ambassador longo told her that fasting is perhaps not recommended over the age of 65 years old so my question to you is what are do you think that we should personalize longevity strategies so perhaps what your your father is doing may be different from what you are doing or when i should be doing so what your what are your thoughts about this concept of personalized longevity medicine okay well first of all i think walter is wrong um but he and i have always disagreed on pretty much everything my father is 82 he eats one meal a day usually and he's thriving but that's not a clinical trial now it is true that you want to have a bit of body fat on you on you on you when you're older you don't want to be too skinny but let me you know repeat what i said skipping meals doesn't mean you have to be thin you can eat a big meal for dinner uh i just did i just got back from a restaurant and i'm eating big meals every dinner and i'm not losing weight so i don't understand why volta says that people over there over a relatively young age shouldn't intermittent fast i don't see any scientific evidence for that i'd be happy to see it but your point about tailoring the treatment is very important i work with clients to give them some advice on diet exercise supplements and i measure their blood work every time i i mean i ask them to measure it because you you can't optimize the body unless you you have a dashboard and we wouldn't drive a car without a dashboard but we do we we don't do the same for our bodies but that's changing rapidly there's a growing movement and also even the fda is appreciating the need for much more monitoring both from uh blood um but also uh these biosensors that are hitting the market uh right now you can you can get a glucose sensor at home uh just order one up and soon you'll be able to order a sensor that you can stick on your chest and it'll measure your body a thousand times a stack and and tell you if you're gonna have a heart attack next week or if you have a flu or a cold if you need an antibiotic or even if you're depressed and that world will be here in a couple of years um it'll be mainstream within 10 and it's going to save trillions of dollars in health care costs because you can send patients home early and monitor them remotely instead of having them in hospital [Music] [Applause] [Music] you
