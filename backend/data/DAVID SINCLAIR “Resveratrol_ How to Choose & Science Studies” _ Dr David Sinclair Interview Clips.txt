[Music] so [Music] where do we buy the right resveratrol in the right concentration where do you get yours yeah i i got mine from the clinical trials i have a a bucket of it in my basement ah okay what you should look for with supplements in general is a trusted brand um so it might be a i won't say a brand name but there are some big companies that would be out of business by now if they broke the rules also look for what's called gmp good manufacturing procedures and this is a i think a a really important thing because if you're not using good manufacturing procedures uh you might be contaminating your equipment that kind of thing so that's good and also look for high quality high grade materials so resveratrol comes in sometimes just 50 pure i would avoid those because they have contaminants some of those contaminants can cause diarrhea and you know that's that's you know just one of the least of your problems if you have contamination so high grade greater than 98 gmp and uh brands that have been around for a while and people trust so those are my best tip tips for finding supplements that work you know the resveratrol field when i first was following it back in i guess the early 2000s um you know i was very skeptical that there would be any effect in humans taking resveratrol because certainly not from drinking a glass of wine but um from supplementing just because it seemed as though like the dose is required to get some really beneficial effects at least in some of the rodent studies seemed sort of you know high and it wasn't it didn't seem very attainable um but as you know this there was a really um sort of compelling primate study in rhesus rhesus monkeys um i forgot when that was published it was like mid-2000s or 2011 or something like that right uh rough photo cabo's group at nih yes that's right um they they gave these rhesus monkeys uh resveratrol and i think they started out with a lower dose like 80 milligrams per kilogram they went up to like 480 any reason do you know why they start with i've seen more than one study do that yeah uh so i just anecdotally what ruffa told me i think is that they started at the low dose and didn't see a change in pulse wave velocity in the blood vessels so they upped it and then that's where they saw the benefit oh okay so um well this study was you know the the the doses were very doable in humans when you you know convert um and and basically they you know feeding these these monkeys they were feeding them like this terrible high high sucrose diet high sucrose and high fat and they like it caused them to have like 40 increased aortic stiffness but the resveratrol completely ameliorated it like yeah so i was like holy crap that's pretty cool um yeah i think that was the one study that sort of changed my view uh and then i started to sort of get into the literature and read more and there's you know there's been a variety of clinical studies as you know and yeah well i'm glad somebody's reading the literature because there was there was a hate me club with resveratrol because it got so much attention anything that gets a lot of attention gets the hate me club in reverse but resveratrol i still take resveratrol probably a gram or so every gram really yeah in my yogurt i don't measure it out i just shake it in so it might be half a gram to a gram this is from your own like stash it's like a stash in the basement the private stash it is i'm not exactly i don't usually find doses of resveratrol above 250 milligrams yeah right you made a good point which is it's a really insoluble molecule and that's one of the well there are two problems with resveratrol one is it's really insoluble so if you just give it as a dry powder to an animal or a human it's less likely to get absorbed we know that as a fact include it with a bit of fat it'll go up five to ten fold in the bloodstream so the big effect we've seen in mice and monkeys is with a bit of fat in the diet as well and then the second problem with resveratrol is that it's light sensitive and so those people who researchers who put it in a plate with worms or didn't treat the molecule with respect it goes brown it goes off it's one of the reasons it's very hard to put in a cosmetic because your cosmetic will turn brown if you if you use brown or resveratrol it won't work so you've got to keep it in the dark in the cold and it'll be fine okay so so we're in a basement cold dark and also i think there's various forms like trans resveratrol i'd go for the trans because when we gave the cis form to the so to an enzyme it didn't activate it but the trans worked brilliantly yeah rafa decarbo actually he's been a good friend over the years a great colleague he did the study with us on the mouse resveratrol study that showed that on a high fat diet those mice were extremely healthy and longer lived and their organs when we they opened up the mice they were pristine so the mice were still obese because we didn't give them a lot of resveratrol it's pretty low dose but their organs were so beautiful their arteries when you stain them for oil or fat it was night and day the ones on resveratrol or the ones without resveratrol were stained with fatty lumps resveratrol clean and that alone makes me say you know resveratrol is probably not going to hurt me and it may very well help my cardiovascular system it seems to be really important for a cardiovascular system like and i'm just kind of wanting to know why why is it we we have a number of ideas and resveratrol is a dirty molecule so there's not just one way it works um so two ins definitely are involved we now have a mouse that's mutant for the resveratrol activation of sort one so we now see that some some aspects like endurance of resveratrol seem to be through certain one so one of the effects is through certain ones anti-inflammatory actions in the lining of the of the blood vessels the endothelial cells oh yeah that seems to be important and uh there's other aspects also in dna repair as well um infiltration of macrophages in there seems to be dampened and we also looked at oxidative stress in those arteries of those mice treated and it was way down in the resveratrol nice yeah with the rhesus monkeys with the you know basically like you know completely reversing that 40 aortic stiffness that's like pretty it's pretty dramatic effect it is and so yeah i think resveratrol it's people are you know always a true is it not 60 minutes did a story and then there was an argument about how it was working and so people are confused about the molecule and i i still stand by it because the results like you say in animals and there are clinical studies now that are really positive in humans uh not all of them sometimes it has no effect there was one study where it interfered with um endurance exercise yeah don't understand that but foreman was kind of shown to do something similar where he prevented mitochondrial adaptations yeah i mean maybe what rhonda what's maybe happening is that if you're dampening antioxidant or dampening free radicals too much you're actually losing that automatic effect exactly the mitosis but um but i haven't seen any downside i mean i'm i'm a n of one in as you would say in a clinical trial i've had my heart checked out with a 3d movie uh mri my heart looks like it's 20 it's got no sign of aging so it doesn't seem to be doing myself and my dad any harm so how long have you been taking it oh gee since 2003 wow and you take a battleground give or so yeah a day [Music]
