[Music] it's clearly one of the most important things for for longevity is to maintain sleep patterns and you can get away with less sleep if you sleep deeply but it's been shown very clearly both in animal studies and in humans that people have like lack of sleep tend to develop chronic diseases including dementia um earlier one of the things that struck me was a 2022 study a recent one that having sleep apnea which i think i suffer from a little bit is a loss of ability to breathe correctly during sleep and it disrupts your sleep it actually some of these people on average developed all sorts of issues with their brain they had increased markers for alzheimer's disease and this is uh one of the problems if you don't eat the right foods and you don't get enough sleep together you your nerves just end up not growing and forming memories and then you get inflammation in your brain so there's a protein that goes up with aging um that's really uh important that um the iva1 it's called and we can stain that in the brain and we see it go up and lack of sleep and also just chronic stress leads to increases in that um and so you want to keep your stress levels down mental stress and we also now know that the brain is definitely controlling the body's immune system and so you can lose your immunity as well if your brain is is not relaxed and getting enough sleep what we've discovered as scientists over the years is that there are proteins that that go up with aging and are markers of inflammation iba one is is just one that we use one that's particularly bad for you is amyloid beta which is a protein that when it's cut into certain sizes it will become insoluble that accumulates both inside cells and outside of cells and outside neurons uh and alzheimer's patients have a lot of what are these called what are called plaques in the brain um and there are a number of drugs that are aimed at getting rid of those plaques antibodies that bind to them and there are cells in the brain that move around that actually eat up those uh those proteins but they don't do a very good job as we get older and one of the things that people are trying to do to cure or at least treat alzheimer's is to target those proteins but what you want to do really that's easier is to prevent them from forming in the first place and one of the enzymes that we work on called cert one one of the stotunes is very good at preventing the buildup of beta-amyloid in the brain and so that's why exercise eating a little less often as well as taking supplements like i do nmn i believe are very good ways at slowing down the accumulation of these little protein fragments that can crystallize and actually become insoluble and disrupt neurons it's like trying to clean out um the trash after it's accumulated whereas you know if you do recycling throughout most of uh the week it's a lot easier to take out the trash at the end of the day uh well one thing that most people don't know about me is that through most of my 20s and 30s i had extremely difficult um um sleep patterns i was i basically was approaching depressed depression because i wasn't sleeping enough and i had to figure out ways to fix it and so like i said with my diet um i'm pretty lazy when it comes to doing things so if i can fix my sleep patterns i think pretty much anybody can and i started to do a few things that worked for me and i've now got this whole program which i'll tell you about now um so i start with trying to be calm at the end of the night i don't watch tv late at night and i try my best not to look at screens though it's increasingly difficult and i turn down the blue light in my screen i wear some blue light blocking glasses most nights unless i'm you know being sociable and i don't want to look like too much of a nerd but i find that that really does help with my eye strain as well i try to just read meditation and do that just before sleep and often that puts me to sleep and so that's working um i also take some supplements i take uh gaba gaba and l-theanine and magnesium and that combination is typically enough i have a warm drink sometimes i have a shower these days i like that more and more and that just puts me in a very calm state uh i reduce the temperature of my bed i have a bed that that you can control the temperature um and being a little cooler is very good particularly during the night when it's cool i sleep most people sleep more deeply those are the those are the main hacks if i can't get to sleep i hatches melatonin and even ambien but i don't take those um very often and i say absolutely need to get to sleep [Applause] [Music] [Applause] you
