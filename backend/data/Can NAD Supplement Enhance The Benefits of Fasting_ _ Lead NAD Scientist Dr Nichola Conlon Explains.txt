[Music] foreign if you understand the role of boosting NAD to slow the biological aging process and to restore cellular energy and repair you'll probably know that intermittent fasting can help to boost the body's production of NAD see you might be wondering if it's possible to double down on this NAD strategy by taking a supplement at the same time well the answer is yes and in this video I am going to discuss how to best manage taking NAD supplements whilst fasting so first of all a quick overview of fasting what is it and why'd you do it well intermittent fasting basically involves going for periodic episodes without food it is more of an eaten pattern rather than a diet because it doesn't involve changes to the amount or type of food that you eat just when you eat it but regardless of the chosen method intermittent fasting has been scientifically proven to have tremendous health benefits human Studies have found that it improves disease indicators such as insulin resistance cholesterol high blood pressure and inflammation and this is even independent of weight loss one of the reasons that fasting has so many benefits is because it actually boosts the level of NAD in your body so how does fasting increase NAD well Studies have shown that NAD levels are heavily influenced by lifestyle in particular things that cause energy stress and the science behind this is simple when cells undergo a period of stress they need to make sure that efficient energy production is maintained and that cellular maintenance and repair is turned up so to do this all cells have a starvation sensor which is called ampk fasting causes energy stress which activates the ampk pathway which leads to increased NAD levels in the cell this rise in NAD occurs via two mechanisms firstly ampk boost levels of a critical enzyme that makes and recycles NAD and this enzyme is called nampt this enzyme is part of the Salvage pathway that recycles NAD in the cell the more nampt that is active the more NAD that is recycled so the more NAD you have in the cell secondly during this period of energy stress your body tends to switch from burning carbohydrate to Fat which increases the NAD nadh ratio meaning that there is more NAD Plus in the cells or the oxidized form this increase in NAD then acts as a signal to activate a critical survival protein called cert1 in response set 1 activates multiple beneficial Downstream Pathways to ensure that the cell can survive the period of stress in fact activation of set 1 has been found to coordinate many of the health benefits of fasting including activation of cellular repair processes recycling of damaged cells and activation of longevity pathways [Music] firstly after fasting your NAD levels will decrease upon refeeding as this means the energy stress has been removed so ampk becomes deactivated this drop in NAD can be mitigated by using an NAD boost in supplement such as time plus during the feeding window to maintain the high NAD levels in between periods of fasting this will prolong cert one activation and extend the cellular benefits of fasting secondly as well as being clinically proven to boost NAD Levels by 242 percent the Cheeto time plus contains active ingredients that are known to activate the ampk pathway these include Sephora Japonica extract which contains the ampk activators written in quercetin and also another activator alpha lipoic acid which together further mimic the fasting process and extend the cellular benefits of fasting [Music] thank you
