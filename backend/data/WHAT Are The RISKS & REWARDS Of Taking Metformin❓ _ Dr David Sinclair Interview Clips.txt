[Music] most doctors are not all but most doctors treat diseases and you know if you take diabetes as an example most people will have increased blood sugar levels the older they get and that's actually a very good sign of aging and how long they will live but if you were to go to a typical doctor in most western countries they would say well you need to pass a certain threshold to be a diabetic and only when you have a disease i will treat you you know go home and don't eat so many potato chips and get off the couch but i'm not going to help you with medicine until you actually have a disease we know that a drug like metformin which is as far as drugs go relatively safe will delay type 2 diabetes if you prescribe it earlier it's a very cheap drug as drugs go and so i i'm encouraging people doctors to think about prescribing metformin before diabetes actually occurs and it's a lot easier to prevent a disease than to try to reverse it scientifically i'll tell you what i think and why i chose to and that is that i looked at the data in let's start with with animal studies it's not always the best but with animal studies i was on a paper with raphael de cabo down at nih the national institutes of health and we showed that metformin delays many diseases in those animals and they they do live uh slightly longer that's good it's obviously not doing them a lot of harm and then when i looked at the literature of other people who did studies on one study was over 10 000 patients veterans that took metformin others um now hundred thousand plus patients who have taken metformin when they look at the risk factors and the at the actually the incidence of diseases of aging not just diabetes but other diseases cancer heart disease frailty alzheimer's their chance of getting those diseases went down as well which is what you'd expect from a true longevity or what some would call an anti-aging drug and here's the striking thing those patients were healthier having diabetes than people who didn't have diabetes and that's remarkable so what does that mean for people who don't yet have diabetes i think it should be even more effective than those people who have been studied now the other thing is i i'm doing a risk reward ratio always with with myself what's the risk of not doing anything pretty high right i know what i'm going to be doing 20 years from now it's not going to be fun i'm 50 i'll be 70 in 20 years and but what's the risk of taking metformin well it does have side effects that can be severe but for most people the most you'll experience is an upset stomach which i'm prepared to tolerate and mitigate with the benefit of potentially having a much healthier older age [Music] you
