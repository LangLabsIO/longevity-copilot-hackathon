[Music] but the genes that i mentioned are called sirtuins they make enzymes that protect the body they send out the troops to repair dna and and get rid of bad proteins that have accumulated they don't work those enzymes don't work at all if they don't have enough nad so nad is a common chemical that our bodies make all the time we need it to survive without nad we'd be dead in probably 30 seconds or less but nad used to be a very boring molecule that was just part of enzymatic reactions but now we know that nad levels control our health and our longevity and that we think our body loses nad and its ability to make nad as we get older but we also know that there are ways to boost nad levels naturally one way is to exercise one way is to be hungry and another way is to take a supplement which consists of a precursor to nad and there are a few different types of those and those are found naturally in the body but we just don't make enough of them as we get older and so a number of people have taken to trying these molecules in a way to get the levels of nad back up to youthful levels [Music] [Applause] [Music] you
