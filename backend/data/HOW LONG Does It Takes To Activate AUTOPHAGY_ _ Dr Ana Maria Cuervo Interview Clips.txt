[Music] because that's gonna depend on which out of body you want to activate and you know at the end of the day you really want to activate them all at the right level you don't want to go crazy you don't want to activate them and i can tell you why you might not be able to even do that you just want to have in an old person out of ideas when this person was young and probably there are differences on what is my proper level of autophagy probably is very different to yours because i'm half of your size so so you know there are going to be factors like that but even considering and that um we were talking about this macro autophagy that one is very sensitive to earlier starvation stage and i'm talking like 30 minutes or one hour of like full starvation it's enough to start activating this process the problem is that we snack in the middle and as soon as you snack things go downhill again so but you know just having the normal period in in between meals should be enough for macro tofadi but you also want to have this very selective chaparral mediated autophagy and for that one you need a little longer so i i this is not publicity and i have nothing to do with this intermediate fasting but we have experimentally tested that these 8 16 hours that people propose like 16 hours without food and eight hours without food and just eat the same calories that you normally eat but just on those two times during the day that works very well to activate it of this because in the eight hours in between meals during the day you will activate your macro autophagy and then when you have the 16 period your cma is gonna go maximal and it's gonna take care of most of what is there at least we have done that in mice and not somebody who become independent from my group is doing now a clinical i mean it's not even called a clinical trial it's an intervention in which people have the same amount of calories but they just eat it two times a day and it's not so difficult actually and they he has been monitoring the peaks of insulin and glucose and you know you have these very beautiful sharp peaks that's what you want right you want nutrients and insulin going up and then going down so you will activate your autophagy when it goes down and then you do it a second time and it seems like people first they don't feel um hungry because they are having the same amount of calories they regulate very well their glucose so we hope that that will be an intervention to reduce the amount of diabetes type 2 and also they have energy because they you know they have their ketone bodies that also activate autophagy during the period of starvation and well starvation those 16 hours that you don't need and if you couple that those 16 hours failing your sleep time better because when you sleep is when your neurons are cleaning and activating autophagy so i always say the same if you have a a store you're going to start cleaning the store when you have the customers right because it's a busy time you are not going to beat them up while people are buying things you normally clean once you close the the door of your store and then you start cleaning so your neurons in a way are the same abdomen or maximal activity you have sun autophagy because you need it but it's mostly for remodeling but the cleaning restorative autophagy happens when we asleep and unfortunately as you know we sleep each time less and we keep munching at night to don't fall asleep so that's an awful combination for autophagy [Music] you
