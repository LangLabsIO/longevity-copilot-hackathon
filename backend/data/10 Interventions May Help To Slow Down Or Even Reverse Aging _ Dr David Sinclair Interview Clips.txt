[Music] what I take it's fairly well known I take Resveratrol I've done that for I think close to 15 years a gram in the morning I take nmn which is an NAD booster which we've shown in my lab and many others have shown improves health and resilience we have a lifespan study that we'll talk about later it's not yet finished but it looks promising I on a semi-regular basis I do take Metformin I do believe that those tens of thousands of people who take Metformin are actually healthier and are living longer than those who don't um so those are the main ones I think in a lifestyle you should eat less often I'm now down to on most days eating one meal a day I have dinner and the rest is just cups of tea and coffee I work out I try to maintain my muscle mass I'm now 50 almost 52. I'm trying to make sure that I don't lose my muscle mass if anything I'm gaining that yeah and so that's those are the main recipes uh reduced stress also get decent sleep is helpful as well I've talked about the reprogramming work that is uh one that I think is going to make a big difference there's lots of labs now Nobel Prize winner winners are now working on this as well it's a lot of money being pumped into that area the ability to measure age accurately has really taken off uh you know that was discovered back in 2012 but now it's routine you can even have yourself tested now and we have clocks for a whole variety of tissues in Mouse and human um and other clocks as well I should mention we going back 10 years ago even four years ago we didn't have these clocks we we all we could do is say yeah that person looks old that's pretty pathetic right well that person is frail now we have these these measures and there's a variety of clocks I won't go into uh another advance in the Aging field would be the cenalytics the ability to delete senescent cells in Mouse and and now in humans which is super exciting that there's new peptides small small proteins that are circulating through the blood that look drug-like uh going into clinical trials now 11 is one of those companies um and and there are lots of others that have been discovered that seem to have benefits kobar in full disclosure I'm on The Advisory Board of that company they have a peptide that looks good for metabolic diseases so these have all happened very recently and I think autophagy has now shown by it's been shown by Maria um Anna Maria Cuervo that she can extend the lifespan of mice by activating chaperone-mediated autophagy or CMA clearing out the proteins that are misfolded in the body or damaged and all of these together I think are you know collectively a revolution in our ability to not just understand why we age but also how to to slow it down and reverse that process foreign [Music]
