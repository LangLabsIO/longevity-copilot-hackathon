[Music] there's an interesting trial where we're going to be part of the axiom launch in february so the astronauts are having their blood taken before and after they come back uh and it's already known that astronauts have a lot of dna damage on their return if you look at their urine or blood you find incredible dna damage molecule you know prolif amounts of dna damage reflective molecules astronauts pilots and flight attendants are dying earlier of age-related diseases in other groups are getting alzheimer's five years earlier than other groups for example it may be more than space radiation there may be zero gravity involved because of the stresses on the cell and high g forces as well as the high co2 in the uh in the space capsule so nasa is very interested in this and especially for flights beyond the van allen belt where would be solar radiation which we found working with brookhaven um really you know like heavy iron radiation it takes 1 20th the dose of that that to cause the cell to become senescent as x-rays so it these are these are very very dangerous and the mars mission will not be possible unless we're able to deal with this so on this flight they're also taking senescent cells up with them um i mean non-senescent salt and same as they become senescent so they're changing the medium and we have to develop all the plastic ware and everything very complicated [Music] you
