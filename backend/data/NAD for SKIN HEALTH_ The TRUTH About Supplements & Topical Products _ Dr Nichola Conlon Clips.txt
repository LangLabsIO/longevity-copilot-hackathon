[Music] n has definitely become a buzzword within uh the the sort of Aging field um and the reason for this is because NAD is is it's found in all of our cells including our skin and it's very important um when it comes to aging because it's very important for producing cellular energy and also for empowering cellular repair within the cells now unfortunately as we get older our NAD declines and um this is a problem because if NAD goes down it means your cells have less energy and they also get less repair and it's known to decrease with age in every single cell in the body including your skin and especially in skin that has been exposed to the sun um you see a a bigger decrease in NAD in Sun Exposed Skin as opposed to um areas of your body that tend to be covered now um boosting NAD um basically um switches back on cellular repair which can improve skin quality um and also NAD um increases cellular energy which again empowers the skin to have better turnover increase barrier function and things like that um and it's not only beneficial to the skin it's beneficial to every cell in your body and and for that reason there are a lot of companies out there um that are are trying to Boost energy um my company is a supplement company that boosts NAD um but this this specific question is is all about skin um because we have started to see um a lot more companies that are advertising skin creams with NAD in it um there are quite a few different ones and they all have a slightly different approach um some companies that I've seen um they just put NAD into the cream um and say you know NAD is a good thing let's put it in a cream put it on our face and hopefully it'll get into the cells and do a good job now I would say for those those approaches definitely doesn't work um NAD is is very unstable um it does not survive well outside of the body it doesn't survive well outside of the cells um you know you can't just po pop it in a cream and hope that it's still going to be in good shape and actually get into the cells the other thing is n is a very big molecule which means that even if it was still intact um it really would struggle to get through into the deeper layers of the skin that it needs to be so other companies have took a different approach and what they do is they use what we call NAD precursors um which is like taking um the building blocks that are needed to actually make the NAD um because inside the cells the cell can then stick those build and blocks back together to produce the whole larger NAD molecule um again um the data out there to show that these these these molecules actually pass into the cells um is is very sparse especially for things like NR and nmn um I personally haven't seen a lot of data to show that these precursors get into the skin the only precursor that has got really good data behind it that does get into the skin is something called nicotinamide and this is a very common skincare ingredient so for some of the the more recent companies that have popped up promoting any um boosting and Skin Care um you know they say that they're they're taking the NAD they're chopping it up into maybe NR or nmn and other precursors um I think if they are having any effect it's probably because those Solutions are containing nicotinamide um and any benefit is probably because of the nicotinamide rather than a more fancy um precursor and also if you look at a lot of the data from the companies you see that the studies they rely on are are studies that are using um nicotinamide to boost NAD and skin cells as opposed to actually doing studies on their own product to show that it's actually boosting the NAD in the cells which is what I was kind of getting at earlier you've got to be very careful when companies are claiming that they've got clinical data is it on the actual finished product or is it on something else um so I think that's that's my sort of really quick take on on those you know companies that are promoting NAD skincare um you know really and and I think this is probably Z where you know would say go back and listen to a podcast that we know all about NAD because we don't have time for it today NAD rather that actually not to use precursors it's actually to switch back on your cell own ability to actually make NAD um because you can put as many precursors as you want into the into the cells you can use nicotinamide you can use NR you can use nmn but actually the real reason why your NAD declines is because the enzyme that actually sticks those building blocks together to form the bigger NAD molecule declines as you get older therefore you can put as many precursors into the body as you want but if you don't fix the root problem which is the decline in that enzyme then you're never going to have any real impact so the best approach is to try and switch on your C's own youthful production of NAD and that applies to the skin and to to everywhere in the body it's known that the reason that NAD declines is because the fact the NAD producing the factory declines as as you nicely put it um that and it doesn't matter whether it's a skin cell whether it's a you know a brain cell or a or whatever cell in the body and muscle cell the the reason it declines is the same so the way you want to boost it is exactly the same and we know that nicotinamide or niacinamide it's sometimes more commonly referred to in skin creams um we know that that is an ingredient that works really well on in in the skin and its mechanism of action is because it's boosting NAD although um a lot of companies you know didn't really realize this or or didn't really talk about it until recently now it it could be done a lot more efficiently if you were putting that precursor in but also giving the cell the capacity to use and recycle it um so I think the best approaches and the types approaches that are now become more available are ones that will you know take advantage of the the science that we Now understand and start combining things like nicotinamide with um activators of the enzymes that actually could use the nicotinamide to actually power this repair within the cells obiously sitting here talking about topical skin care but actually everything that we experience especially in terms of skin health and aging is ultimately starting inside of us at the cellular level so really that contradicts that everything that we try and do which goes from the outside really we should be starting from from the inside so um yeah we we know that taking supplements to boost NAD such as Neto does improve skin quality and skin Health um but yeah often it's one of the the later effects to be seen as the nads prioritized for other body systems that may be requiring it more it's no you know it's it's very well known that often the first thing go when our health goes is the quality of our hair skin and Nails because the you know the body doesn't prioritize it as [Music] much
