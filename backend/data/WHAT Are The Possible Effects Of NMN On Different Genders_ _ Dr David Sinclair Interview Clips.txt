[Music] right well in mice there are almost always sex differences um 36 benefits males a little bit more and a man in in my lab we found benefits females a little bit more for longevity and and prevention of frailty or delaying of frailty uh so it depends on the molecule but generally our approaches work in both sexes uh and you know i don't know and i think nobody knows whether if there's a sex difference and gender difference in mice there's also a difference in humans so i don't think we can just extrapolate we need to test it uh and in in the case of an nad booster which is a relative of nmn that i'm helping put through clinical trials in humans that molecule has been in both males and females and they respond very similarly in terms of raising an a.d and i can talk about this now because there was a conference at nih where it was uh the results were revealed so what we see is in both males and females if you take one gram of nmn orally every day which i would say you should take it in the morning if you're going to take it because that's when your energy levels should go up uh that you roughly double your nad levels in the blood that's both male and females and if you take two grams you'll triple it uh and people my age typically have half the levels of nad um for this or two in activity and so that that's why i take a gram a day to try and maintain youthful levels of nad uh but there is there are some anecdotal anecdotal differences uh with nr and nmn with males and females reacting to it um and again it's it's an anecdote so uh you know take it as a story at this point but i've seen enough and heard enough to think that there's probably something to it in the case of females i've known a large number you know more than could be coincidental who have felt changes to their their body um so i'm not saying this is definitely scientific but things to look out for if you're a woman you start taking in a man you might notice that your menstrual cycle is more youthful to put it bluntly and maybe even moods can change which might be hormonal i'm guessing um and one of the reasons for thinking that this might be true is in mice we've published with uh lindsay wu one of my former postdocs in sydney that we can reverse female infertility in old age and as far as you know we're the only group that can do that we give those mice and men for just a month and they start producing babies at the age of the equivalent of a 70 year old human and the ovaries come back to life so it's possible that that's what's going on if women are taking high dose of nmn so i'm not a doctor but i would think that if i was a female i'd i'd start on a low dose 250 milligrams perhaps and just see how your body reacts and do that you know with your doctor's um knowledge of course because if you're gonna mess with hormones your doctor should know about that in the case of men there's a lot less known about that but it's feasible that our hormones are also affected and there's a really good paper that shows that one of the sortuans these are the genes we work on that control we think aging and longevity as well as defenses but one of the things that was found for 32 is that it controls hormone production in male and female mice and in human cells and so it's also feasible that men have a reaction like that so i would say for men as well um monitor your hormone levels which are it's easy to do your doctor could do it there are some commercial places that measure estrogen progesterone testosterone um just to make sure that you're not going out of the normal range [Music] you
