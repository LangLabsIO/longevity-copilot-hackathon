[Music] so the work we do at in my lab at Harvard and in lifespan my my book I explained The Cutting Edge technology but I also in the book I talk about simple things we can do right now to stay healthy and stay alive until these really potent drugs and Technologies are available that can probably cure many different diseases at once and the simple steps are probably you've you've all all all the listeners have heard of some of these we know that aging can be slowed down by moving so you want to stand up you want to go take 4,000 steps at least a day I have a standing desk at work usually um eating the right Foods eating very fresh uh pesticide free foods try to pick colors from across the rainbow uh my partner Serena pun is a nutritionist she tells everyone to eat colored Foods the reason for that is interesting we believe that uh the chemicals that are in colored Foods actually turn on our natural defenses against the aging process there are enzymes in our body uh that protect us and exercise and eating well turns these protections on um if you want to stay looking good avoid sunlight as much as you can avoid radiation this does speed up aging we know that for sure um and the other the really really big one is to reduce the amount of psychological stress uh and get enough sleep these things if you don't do those then you get cortisol which builds up in your body and we know that that can accelerate the aging process too fasting is designed to do one main thing which is to make your body feel like it it's under adversity so it's a threat to survival the same way running is a threat the same way eating foods that are colored these are foods that are typically uh under stress themselves and and could die and you could run out of food the other thing that's that you can do to turn on the body's defenses against aging is to give periods where you're not eating get let them rest from eating and the problem with with nutrition today typically is that there's this idea that you should always be or you should never be hungry right early morning meal and then have snacks at in mid morning and then have a lunch it's craziness because what what we know from the science of Aging is that the body when it's getting a lot of food or constant food it doesn't fight aging the enzymes that I work on they're called cins there are seven seven of them in every cell they get Switched Off by food so what I try to do is uh not e eat in the morning I have a cup of tea I have you my morning drink to keep me going and you it fills my stomach but I try not to eat until the late afternoon every day if I can and then I have one meal a big meal uh a dinner and that means my body's is fighting aging throughout the day um if you get hungry you can drink a lot you can have some snacks have some dates have some nuts but try not to eat in my view more than two and preferably try to eat one big meal a [Music] day
