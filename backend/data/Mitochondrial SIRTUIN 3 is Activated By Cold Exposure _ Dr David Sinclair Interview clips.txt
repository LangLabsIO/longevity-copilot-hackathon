[Music] so [Music] well when i was writing my book my editor said you should put this cold therapy in and saunas and i rolled my eyes i wanted to write a really scientifically based book but i looked into it anyway and actually found that there was decent scientific evidence that both of these approaches could work um in saunas because the saunas have been around since pre-roman times there's a there's more evidence that they're good for you uh there are finnish studies in from finland looking mostly at men for whatever reason so the finnish typically sort of bathe as they call it a few times a week they have them at home and it's very clear that the more times you go in the sauna per week the less cardiovascular disease and heart attacks you have as a man i don't know about women but probably the same and so that i think that raising the core body temp well not core but the surface and lung temperature of your body may induce hormesis we know heat shock proteins that come on with heat can extend lifespan of animals so that makes sense and on the cold side we don't know as much about that it's it's more recent but we do know that coal does induce what's called brown fat which we have on our shoulders and back only discovered 15 years ago to exist in adults babies have it because they don't shiver they actually use their brown fat to stay warm and brown fat is very healthy metabolically it burns energy it's got lots of mitochondria and it's thought that the brown fat secretes little molecules in the bloodstream that's helping the rest of the body so there is some evidence that being cold and shocking your body that way is also increasing hormesis um there's a certain called so two and number three so three and that one is induced dramatically in levels by cold and so again just more evidence that putting your body into adverse conditions the way we used to live before we had air conditioning and heating uh can really be beneficial [Music] [Music] you
