[Music] so the next question would then be how much improvement can you actually gain if you have never done strength training and you now want to begin to do strength training and i want to focus on the early aging 65 to 70 and also on the very old ones and the first study here is a an attempt to compare people between 60 and 70 average age of 67 years of age with young individuals and you can see on the and the top graph there on graph a where it's indicated what how much they could lift one time the maximal force that they could lift one time and the open circles are the young ones and the close circles are the elderly ones and you can see that the young ones are stronger when the training started but 13 weeks later when they did regular strength training they had improved as had also the elderly and in fact if you look to the right top there mvc of isometric and isokinetic strength you can see that the maximum strength improvement is exactly the same in the young and the elderly individuals and if you look at the lower graph with mri again cross-section area whether you measure this only at the vastus lateralis muscle or the whole quadriceps muscle there is exactly the same improvement in young and elderly individuals so despite some of the studies out there saying that your ability to gain muscle strength maybe already declines when you are 50. i think this data and also some other data would support the view that all the way up to basically 6570 the potential of improvement strength is still present [Music] [Applause] [Music] you
