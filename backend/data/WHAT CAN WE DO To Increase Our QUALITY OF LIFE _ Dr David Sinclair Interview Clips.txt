[Music] uh someone writes my internal grandmother died at 104. 100 birthday was amazing she was happy and lucid but by 103 my guesses she would have loved to skip that last birthday extending life is one thing having quality is another one of the most important aspects of your research that would we should pay attention to that increase quality of life outside known things like exercise good diet improve sleep uh yeah so this is this is a typical case that the older you live faster you die which is a good thing right i think we all know somebody who's become sick at 50 and it can be very drawn out painful and expensive process whereas here people who live over 100 tend to cost only a third of the medical costs of the rest of us so that's something this is a very positive story so the other question at the bottom is what should we do to increase quality of life besides exercise good diet and improved sleep well if you do those things and you don't smoke and you maintain flexibility and a social network uh you're already estimated to get another 15 years of life beyond those who don't so it's pretty easy to get another decade and a half going beyond that getting to 100 that's that's more challenging because as i'll explain our bodies are losing information all the time and trying to preserve that information is tough uh but what else could we do you know the supplements that i'm taking i'm hoping will enhance the benefits of the exercise and the good diet uh the sleep is definitely important we know that the genes that control sleep are intimately related to the genes that control our lifespans that's that's not a coincidence um i think keeping the brain active is very very important um so continuing to work or continuing to do stimulating activities um is key as well um yeah avoiding things that will slow down your blood flow you know vascular dementia is a is a major problem in society and we need to keep that blood flowing so exercise will do that um but what will also happen uh is if you uh just go walking and get your uh your body moving that will also um do wonders actually another thing you can do is to get or to stay with your partner uh stay with your social group and even get a pet pets do uh correlate with longer lifespan yeah often people who live over 100 also two things they say they say they drink red wine they have olive oil and they have a good sense of humor and they never get totally stressed out about life which uh it does make sense constant cortisol levels cannot be good for you we've seen what happens to presidents during their time right exactly [Music] [Music] you
