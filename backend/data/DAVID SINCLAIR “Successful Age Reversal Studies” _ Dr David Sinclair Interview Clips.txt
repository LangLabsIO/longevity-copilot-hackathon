so [Music] you've shared the research on twitter recently from the team who proved that blood plasma of younger rats injected into older rats made older rats genetically younger but also cleaned up senescent cells what's your gut feel on what causes that do you think that blood young blood plasma can reset yamanaka factors as you described them in your book now obviously i know what a yamanaka factor is but for anyone out there who doesn't do you want to give us some background and address that broader question thomas is asking yeah well thomas i don't know if you're a scientist but that those are the kind of questions we ask in in my lab so the yamanaka factors are the genes that we use to reprogram the eye those three genes os and k um it would make perfect sense that young blood is resetting the biological clock and turning on those yamanaka genes the same way we're doing and we've actually designed experiments to test if that's true it would make perfect sense that young blood is resetting the age of that mouse what was it 54 on average um because right now we don't know of any other way to reset the body um senescent cells getting rid of them that's really interesting it means that the body can clear out senescent cells we know that when we're young we can clear them out we have immune cells that detect and kill them but as we get older they they become immune to the immune system and so maybe this young blood says okay wake up again go kill those senescent cells those zombie cells um so what what that experiment the reason i tweeted about it is that if it's true and actually steve horvath was the one that did the clock so i believe him he's the guy that invented the clock i called him up and i said steve are you kidding me you just took off the half the age of the mouse is that true and he said yeah it's kind of hard to believe and i said surely they just mixed up the rats and he said no no really we can tell from the dna that they didn't mix up the rats but that's stunning if you can take the biological age of a rat back 50 it means that there are factors that you could one day inject into a person and possibly have the same effect now i'm not condoning going to bleed your younger relatives and have a transfusion or anything that i think is is kind of risky and in fact in the us that's been outlawed because we don't know enough of the side effects of that but i do believe it's a proof it is some proof that at least in rats you can reset the age of an entire animal how do we you know stop aging and i know in some cases we can reverse aging yeah yeah we can 10 years ago if i'd said we can reverse aging people would have said that's impossible and thrown me out of the lecture theater but now it's okay now now that we've shown and of course some of my colleagues have done this too it's not just me we've shown that first of all there's there's a clock in our bodies that you can read i could take your blood today and go back to my lab and measure little chemical changes called methyls on the dna and i could say well you're actually 36 you're probably you look really young actually so you probably are younger than most people your own age or you might be older heaven forbid um but you know half the people will be above huff will be below and what that's telling us is that you're losing information now some of us in the lab have figured out ways to uh scrub those chemicals off like you would brush your teeth and get the plaque off and then the the dna gets red like it was young again and now cells work like they used to anyway what we did was we we took mice mice are easier to work with than humans of course so we took old mice and uh they went blind because they were old or we could induce in their eyes the disease glaucoma which you'll know is pressure in the eye that disrupts the retina and in both those cases we could rejuvenate the eyeball and get the retina at the back of the eye to work again and those old mice could see again like they were young and we measured the age of the eye the nerves at the eye and they literally were younger based on this clock that i was describing to you so what does that mean it means for the first time we can apparently safely reboot the system and get very complex tissues and organs to work again like they did when we were teenagers wow wow now have that's been done in any humans at any capacity uh very little uh so it'll be probably another two years before that technology that we used which is a gene therapy it requires an injection in the eye uh that'll be in humans in two years if all goes well so we've we've raised the money the capital to do that but there's a lot of safety studies before you go into a person with a gene therapy although i will i will tell you that we're not using anything totally new uh there are backs not vaccines but gene therapies in the eye already to correct genetic defects so it's it's not a sign science fiction as you might think um has it been done in people well there's been one study where people were treated with a cocktail of metformin the diabetes drug and uh growth hormone and uh what was the third oh dear which some of our listeners here today may recognize is hormone that goes down with age and they found by measuring the clock the dna or 88 d-h-e-a okay okay i'm familiar with that yeah and they could get the clock to go back by a couple of years which you know is on the borderline of yeah show me show me again i want better evidence and there were only nine people so i would say it's early days it's it's like the wright brothers and maybe they've skipped over a sand dune but show me you can fly for an hour and believe you that's where we're at [Music] so [Applause] you
