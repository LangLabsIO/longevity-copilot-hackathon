so [Music] awesome what's the biggest hurdle right now to be being able to to boot up that back up again the full backup of like the whole epi genome you know a full body reset yeah i mean that's that'd be nice well i mean that's what we work towards in my life every day uh this is our goal can i all can i like reset only like the good bits can we like can we like leave out you know like that time i was an you know in college like can we just like not reset that one yeah yeah well i think we we can we're going to retain our memories we're going to retain our wisdom and our current personality that's the prediction but we're going to regain the ability to think uh and store memories liking like we did when we were young and that's true for other parts of the body uh muscle strength we just achieved muscle age reversal we have age reversal of skin so we're taking off the organs one by one and tissues but we've also done the whole animal we can express as we say turn on these three embryonic genes in the whole animal and we know for sure that it's safe in those animals we turned it on at high levels for a year and didn't turn it off new usually the treatment's only four to six weeks eight weeks at the most but we kept it on for a year no sign of any adverse effects in those mines now the holy grail would be to know if those mice live longer and they're younger we don't know because the journal and the reviewers of our paper made us kill them to to check on the number of tumors in inside and it turns out they had if anything a trend towards having fewer tumors than the untreated old mice but now we're repeating that experiment but one of the problems with current technology is evenly distributing gene therapies across the body it tends to accumulate in the liver mainly and so give us another couple of years and we should be able to do that and then we can do that experiment in a really clean way and hopefully we can keep resetting those mice and make a mouse live for a couple of decades instead of just two years yeah i i saw with this three gene combination you said you can reset cells by in mice 75 was a number i heard and and you can measure the the age of of the cell and the body so like measuring that you found that there was not like a full reset but 75 amp and bad yeah it's even more remarkable than that so we do use um chemical marks that control the epigenome as a clock um stephen horvath at ucla is the guy that gave his name to that or bath clock as we call it but uh what what is exciting about what what we can do is we can measure those changes with this cheeks but we also know is that that's just the an indicator of what's truly going on in the cell and that is that the music of of our lives like on that cd truly the music of our lives gets replayed from a younger state so what does that mean so we've got 20 000 genes let's say there's there's 2 000 that become misregulated during aging we found that the majority of those get reset back to the level that they should be when the eye was young so think about this that there are genes that come on when they shouldn't during aging in the eye and genes that got shut off when they shouldn't during the aging eye and the reset restored those exactly near exactly to where they should be so that cell somehow knows that a gene that came on should go off and if jesus got shut off she'd come back on how does it know that we don't know that that that's what we're chasing right now i think that's the nobel prize if someone wants to get it [Music] [Applause] [Music] you
