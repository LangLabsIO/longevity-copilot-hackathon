[Music] I started taking Resveratrol in my early 30s so yeah I'm now 52. um and I don't regret it at all at the time it wasn't known if it would do anything all we had was yeast cells living longer and then we showed worms and flies and it was really early days but I took it anyway um figuring if it doesn't hurt me you know it's it's not really a risk but I really am glad that I have done that because I I do believe that my health internally and externally and how I look is partly due to that so I've been taking a gram of Resveratrol for all those years over a decade and uh and it turns on the race defenses um I also take uh nmn which I've talked about before which raises NAD levels just like vitamin B3 but even better and that I think is is important nmn is is interesting because we've shown in animal studies uh and um and we're working on human studies now increases blood flow in muscle for sure in the brain but also I I believe it would work in the skin as well so I think that blood flow is very important for the skin actually we know it is and even the hair the lack of blood flow of hair is partly what leads to hair loss and so that's one of my my tips yeah I also wanted to mention that PRP is platelet-rich plasma and it's filled with lots of goodies uh exosomes it's filled with peptides that are coming out of those cells um all the good things and you can use it on your skin and on your hair so something that's that somebody asked about is cenolytics proceedings some people call it physician which is a cellytic so these are natural molecules that kill or at least uh help to kill senescent cells these are the zombie cells that accumulate in all of our tissues and also in the skin we can see them actually build up um in the around the hair follicle and in the sebaceous gland and they're really bad they cause inflammation they cause aging so you can you can taste analytics and uh somebody mentioned earlier Jim Kirkland who's a colleague and friend of mine he's been running clinical trials on these molecules with some really promising results and so I I think trying these out on myself as you'd like to be a guinea pig and I I went through a course of uh synolysis analytics um about uh about nine months ago and I I did it with um Chris Christie and phys Eden and what I found was uh it was really quite remarkable in my own experience I did it for a month um and I took um both those compounds every morning mixed with my yogurt and my Resveratrol I actually found that my skin looked a lot better after that month and people actually noticed it these are not scientific studies of course but but you can try them that there doesn't seem to be any downside to doing it you can actually hesitate you can go online and go to clinical trials.gov clinicaltrials.gov and look up James Kirkland and look up is Eaton f-i-s-e-t-i-n get a pen write this down and or write in centilitic and you'll see the protocol for his clinical trials okay and you can if you want talk to your doctor if you and I recommend you do because anything that's a major change with supplements could harm you especially if you're taking other medicines and supplements but you can look at what he does and get get a guide as to what might work for you [Music]
