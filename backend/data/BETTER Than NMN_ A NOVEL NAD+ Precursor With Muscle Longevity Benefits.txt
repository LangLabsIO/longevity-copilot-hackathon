[Music] and for the invitation this is my first time in person here it's a great event so happy to be here and to share with you today sand a new Ned precursor trigonelline with with muscle longevity benefits across species so actually by looking at the structure of tonin what emerges is that not nothing more than a meila form of nicotinic acid or niin which is a known Ned precursor it has also been let's say around or known to the to the people for a long time already for its anti-diabetic effects essentially in the context of several Mouse models to amarate metabolic syndrome what's also important to know is that it's a molecule that is present in our bodies but is actually largely produced in Plants such as fenri seeds coffee beans and so on and in fact actually when you drink coffee you will most likely get a spike of trigell in your plasma also there is very early evidence from the 80s that um there that people have tried to do biochemical characterization for whether there could be a possibility to demate trigonelline and seems like the liever may be able to do so and to generate nicotinic acid so with this in mind and having measured trigonal in theum of patients we before doing experiments we wanted to really just do a very simple experiment and there are two interesting um things to notice here so we wanted to test the stability of trigonal in human serum so we just spiked trional in at 1 Millar at 37Â° in serum and we took along actually the two of the most famous NAD precursors currently on the market also you have seen the talk from Morton about NR and nnm and we looked at the stability in Ser in serum so trigonelline is very very stable and that's interesting for us and that's good to know um however this is something that is known and it's not a critic or anything it's just to raise the awareness that although the NAD percursors they do work they do come with some complications and especially for clinical translation this is very relevant to keep in mind so uh for instance an RN M at 2 hours they already significant decline in serum and at 24 hours they are largely gone and if you look here at their structure essentially it's um resemble each other and in fact you can see that for instance they release abundantly a num when uh present in the serum so again this is just to keep in mind that for clinical translation it's very important to measure and look at the NAD metabol uh when we provide supp um precursors um you have seen in the beautiful talks already throughout these days aging is basically characterized by the several dysfunctional marks that occur um across different tissues and about possible interventions to Target the agging all marks what's also important to note that in the context of muscle aging some of these all marks um are also shared with sarcopenia which is the loss of muscle function and mass indeed associated with aging from a clinical perspective there are several um worldwide aligned guidelines on how to define sarcopenia and there are essentially three main parameters used as indicators of muscle Health gate speed grip strength and appendicular lean mass which I will also use in the next slide so keep these three parameters in mind so recent work indeed before I joined uh n research was trying to focus on how to characterize further looking at muscle biopsis sarcopenic H marks but they did so by looking at several cohorts scattered across the globe and in particular here I'm showing the sort of clinical features of of Singaporean Court where you can see here the three uh clinical readouts of muscle health and what they um what they did by uh essentially looking at these two cords and looking at muscle biopsies on one end is they found that the transcriptomics level and proteomics level down regulation mitochondria function however what also emerged very clearly is that in the muscle of sarcopenic patients NAD levels were declined and importantly although the amount of samples here of musle biopsies was low n levels were positively correlated with the three indicators of muscle health so with gate speed grip strength and appendicular lean mass now with this in mind when I joined uh and we launched the project as a followup to further characterize now uh what could be systemic factors or molecules linked to what we have seen especially considering the muscle levels of NAD where declined uh we U made a use of serum samples from the same Singaporean cohort from which we analyzed the muscle biopsis and we tried to look at for instance metabolites that may be linked for instance to NAD in particular vitamin B3 um related metabolites and looking this the only one that was significantly changed and in particular downregulated in the sarcopenic C was this metabolic called trigonelline importantly as for dnad muscle trigonal levels in the serum also positively correlated with Lan Mass grip strength and walking speed and also very interestingly when we looked at how the serum Trigon levels were associated in a positive manner with the um uh with Pathways in the muscle biopsis what emerged by far is that the most positively Rich pathway was the oxos um related genes you can see here the enrichment on the U enrichment score plot and also here the uh genes that are enriched in the particular Gene set we started with the human primary myotube cells shown here by where we show that Trion link and those dependently increase NAD levels and it actually even works in primary myot tubes there I from sarcopenic patients indicating that actually it's possible to have a response to trigonelline even if you may have sarcopenia we then switch to see Elegance as a shortlived animal model and we saw that Trigon can increase n levels or restore n levels to a more youthful State and when we gavaged adult young mice with trigonelline for two hours we observed a consistent increase in NAD levels across several tissues next we wanted actually to uh really uh map the conversion route of trigell in into the N biosynthesis pathway and here in this cartoon here you there are some of the pathways that also evandro and tfer have mentioned for instance you have the PRI pathway that makes use of nicotinic acid through the nprt enzyme to produ to produce NAD and you have the Salvage pathway which uses Nam and uh basically or the nrk pathway through NR to generate an NM and N ad and this basically the key enzyme here is an nmpt which you may have heard of before so what we did here we also leveraged the use of Inhibitors such as FK 66 for n and two Roxy nicotinic acid that is essentially an inhibitor for mprt and then we test this in the wi or without supplementing the precursors so what you see here in control conditions in myot tubes when you supplement either n r or trigonelline you get a nice increase in NAD levels however when we you now C- treat with two hydroxy nicotinic acid to block and PRT trigonelline doesn't work anymore and further more when we now combine the two Inhibitors and we go we do per extended experiments to induce NAD depletion with FK 66 which is known to occur in several cell types with this inhibitor you can see that trigonal and NR that can nicely rescue NAD levels and even boost them further with an R indicating that indeed trigonelline does not seem to rely on the Salvage pathway but when we now Co combine the two Inhibitors trigonal complete effects are completely abolished really supporting the idea that it makes use like the nicotinic acid of the Pressler pathway next we wanted to couple the same experimental design that I mentioned you before for the NAD levels and keeping in mind the use of the inhibitors for the two Pathways here looking at mitochondrial function in particular we looked at mitochondrial membrane potential and MIT maximal mitochondrial respiration again due to n depletion now in this case you see that the mitochondrial respiration readouts are declined but are promptly rest restored by either trigonelline and NR to comparable manner but when we now combine FK 66 with two drxy nicotinic acid trigonelline is not able to restore mitochondrial function as well anymore compared to an art that instead just works just fine because can bypass the two uh Pathways next we want actually to test the benefits since that was our interest from the beginning on muscle aging of trigonal we started again with the c Elegance due to the fact that he a short- lived animal and we treated the worms from day one of Aude actually to bypass any potential effect on development when we looked at muscle fiber integrity trigonelline was able to actually ameliorate the muscle aging aging phenotype and this was mirrored by actually an improvement in the mobility of the worms because you see less paralysis here in blue in the worms over time compared to the control condition and very importantly trigonelline was also able to extend lipin but he was doing so uh with a relying basically on the expression of mt1 which is the war morue for mprt mamals so indicating that our there is an evolutionary conservation of the utilization of trigonelline for also muscle benefits that requires the Press pathway finally we wanted actually to go back to mamalin and uh to do so we made use of two years old mice a supplemented chronically with tonalin for 12 weeks and uh at the end of the study after supplementation we measured grip strength and in C2 muscle Force this is a protocol essentially where you take a muscle of interest in our case we use the TA muscle and then you force through electrical stimulations repeated contractions of the muscle to induce muscle fatigue so from this uh uh long-term treatment we got sort of two uh kind of sets of phenotypes if you want on one end the L Mass was not impacted and the peak Force so the maximum force that the mouse can do when you force the muscle to contract was not changed however the grip strength in this mice was there was a small but significant rescue and now and this was also mirrored by an improvement in the muscle fatig phenotype you can see here that when you start um the repeated contractions in the muscle of the Aged mice here in Black there's a steep decline in the amount of force that it can generate versus the uh young mice here in Gray which do not which recover much uh easier in that sense and here with Trion we sort of partially rescue this phenotype showing here this intermediate um uh phenotype here in blue so there is of course much more that we could discuss but time is short so I want to conclude by acknowledging uh all the people that helped us with their [Music] expertise
