[Music] so [Music] well um you and i have talked about this before but i'm doing hyperbaric treatments i've done 40 of them 40 90 minute treatments over the past few months how's it feeling i don't know i feel pretty good good i always feel good that's what's confusing well i've been doing so much for so long yep and the hyperbaric treatments the reason why i'm doing it is because of that study out of israel you want to tell people about that uh yeah so this is a study out of israel it's um a group that has a chamber built by germans which is ironic over in israel and yeah yeah so i went in this chamber actually i visited them uh before covert some of my good friends over there and what they do is they put you you pro i don't know if yours is the same but this is a really big room and you can fit about 20 people in there and they give you oxygen so extra oxygen and then they raise the pressure up and then they drop it and raise it is that what you've been doing yeah and so what happens i think to the body is the body's going oh i've got too much oxygen so it responds and then the decrease oxygen makes you feel hypoxic like running so this is a way of getting you might view exercise without having to exercise and then you turn on these longevity genes and i would bet though i haven't proven it yet though i am working on it is that some of these genes that we've discovered the sortuans was discovered to be involved in aging we didn't discover them uh are activated by this hyperbaric chamber and what they showed in this paper that got probably you excited as well as everyone else is they looked at the ends of chromosomes which shorten over time the telomeres and actually got longer after this therapy and that is a sign of reversing aging it's not as good as the clock that i'm developing but it is a good sign and they decided after examining these people from 90 min or 90 days doing 60 sessions that it gave you the equivalent of 20 years decrease in biological age in israel researchers claim to have successfully reversed the biological aging process by using oxygen therapy we are taking the patient into hyperbolic chamber increasing the pressure and by increasing the pressure we are increasing the capacity of the molecules that can go into the lungs and through the lungs to the system the treatment has been shown to increase telomere length telomeres are the protective caps at the end of chromosomes structures located inside our cells that carry our genetic information as the human body grows older the telomeres begin to shorten until they no longer protect the chromosomes and that's when cells begin to die the oxygen therapy also benefits stem cells which serve as a repair system for the body the most powerful trigger that we have in our body that can stimulate stem cells is hypoxia is lack of oxygen because when there is lack of oxygen it serves as a signal to the body so to tell him oh there was epoxy and now do we have a problem let's start to replicate we need you we need you guys come along replicate and come along so what we can do we can take a person hold his breath stop his heartbeat he will have epoxy and then he will have stem cells there is only one problem with regard to that this is unhealthy so we thought about it more and we said okay what the body actually sense does the body sense absolute values or does the body sense fluctuations does he sense relative value so we have generate a certain protocol where we are taking the patient into the chamber increasing the blood oxiganation to very high level and then do a fast decline back to the normal value and then going up and down again we are generating fluctuation and this decline from very high back to the normal is being interpreted by the body as epoxia as lack of oxygen even though the body have extra oxygen and by doing that we are both replicating the stem cells and giving them the area where they can settle down and build up the tissue you can see cerebral blood flow that is increasing to an area that previously didn't have blood flow but we can also see the microstructure of the brain we can actually see the the bundles of the of the white matters in the brain so we can see that combined with that and see the clinical improvement whatever it is cognitive function motor function speaking capabilities coordination and things like that results from one of tel aviv university's studies found that the telomere length of four key cells increased by over 20 percent for the first time in human beings we were able to demonstrate that together with the improvement in the functional measurements brain perfusion brandman construction cognitive function we can also reverse the aging at the cellular level we'll prove that in human beings not animal models we can elongate the telomere length this is dna sequence of dna and reduce the amount of the senescence which is the aging malfunction himself [Music] we talked about cancer a little bit as well we also talked about wim hof um is there any studies around breath work in you know over oxygenation because i know that from the stuff i've read that usually cancer if you're you're looking at the the this place that it is cancer tends to grow in an acidic environment people talk about how if you're over oxygenated that's an alkaline environment um do you know of any anything around breath work and over oxygenating the body that way [Music] well yeah so the warburg effect is what it's called and cancer cells love sugar uh and don't use a lot of oxygen for that reason they're in a hypoxic state whereas the opposite is hyper oxygenation and now i i don't think uh that i've seen evidence that just breathing a lot would make any difference but you can do hyperbaric chamber therapy and there is some really interesting data that just came out not on cancer but on what was it was dementia i believe um and there's also is a paper that came out looking at telomeres the ends of the chromosomes that that represent your age and get shorter as you get older they reversed that process with age just with some therapy in this hyperbaric oxygen chamber so i think there's some merit to it and i i've done some work on this as well we find that i won't get too much into it but having as you get older your muscles get tricked into thinking that there's not enough oxygen around they become hypoxic and that they shut their own mitochondria down because they think oh this person's not breathing enough they've gone to the top of mount everest so they don't don't make as much mitochondria the problem there is that your body's in a state of hypoxia which is bad you don't make mitochondria you don't make energy you feel probably you feel lethargic and we found that by blocking that process and getting the cells back in a couple of weeks to feeling normal mice could now run twice as far on a treadmill that was super healthy super fit had the energy back and so yeah it's this oxygen stuff and mitochondria is intimately linked to aging um and the older you get the less mitochondrial activity you have now you can boost that up again probably by exercising uh by being a bit cold um and perhaps even by heavy breathing that part i don't know about but it's really important um and i think it's the future for a lot of therapies given what i've seen [Music] you
