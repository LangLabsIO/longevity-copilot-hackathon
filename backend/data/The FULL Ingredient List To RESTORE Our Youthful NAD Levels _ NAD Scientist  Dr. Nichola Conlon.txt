[Music] the really efficiently boost NAD in a sustainable way you actually need to fix the underlying issues within the cell that are causing NAD to decline in other words you need a combination of interventions that goes far beyond simply providing the cell with precursor of ingredients but actually restores the body's ability to make and recycle its own NAD just like it did when it was younger so again going back to our little diagram how do we actually do this so you need to use what we describe at nichito as a whole system approach and this means doing multiple things it means looking exactly what's going on at the biology and trying to fix the individual components instead of kind of just ignoring them like many other companies do so to boost NAD efficiently there's there's a multiple things you need to do the first thing is that you need to increase the cell's ability to make its own NAD because cells are really very good at making NAD when they're young they just lose it as they get older and to do this you can actually increase the levels of this nampt enzyme and increasing any MPT the rate limit an enzyme that actually recycles NAD it means that you can increase the cells of ability to recycle NAD from the waste nicotinamide so you you are improving this recycling capacity which is actually declining with age but works perfectly well in young cells the other thing that's really important to note is that older cells are really wasteful of NAD there's multiple other things that have gone wrong in cells which are causing them to to just chew up NAD unnecessarily and one of the really important ones is cd38 expression of this enzyme massively increases as you get older and it's linked to levels of inflammation in the body which increases you get older and actually cd38 uses so much NAD that even if you can inhibit cd38 just a little bit you can massively increase NAD levels without even doing anything else so looking at cd38 inhibition is incredibly important to stop the cell from wasting NAD because there's no point making it and trying to boost it if your cells are just wasting it so the next part of this presentation I'm actually going to take you through all of the ingredients that material time plus has in it and I'm going to explain to you exactly what they do in our formulation and how they work together to boost NAD levels so first of all Sephora Japonica this is one of the ingredients that we have in our formulation and the dried flowers of the Sephora Japonica tree contain the powerful flavonides quasetin rooting and trucks routine now these flavonoids were selected for our formulation based on their ability to increase levels of the nampt enzyme so remember this is the enzyme that is absolutely critical or rate limiting for the recycling of nicotinamide back into fresh NAD but it actually declines with age meaning nicotinamide can't be recycled the nicotinamide builds up you get methyl donor depletion so this group of flavonoids actually increase nampt enzyme levels and therefore improve NAD Recycling and production now as well as their NAD boosting capabilities there's also robust scientific evidence to show that these flavonides also have a like a whole host over the range of Health promoting benefits including antioxidant effects anti-inflammatory effects and also highly topical right now antiviral properties so additionally we've also got corsetin in there which falls under the category of substances known as cenolytics which I won't go into today I know some of you will be familiar with cnlx but these compounds clear senescent cells from the body yeah the next ingredient is green tea extract so you'll all be aware that green tea is one of the healthiest beverages on the planet and much of this is accredited to the powerful compound that it it contains called epigally catechin 3 Galley which is abbreviated to e g c g and in the Tito time plus egcg is used to inhibit the methylating enzyme nnmt so if you remember this is the enzyme that is actually methylating the buildup of nicotinamide and excreting it from the cells so it's actually promoting excretion rather than Recycling and you find that you get an increase in the levels of this enzyme as you get older so egcg inhibits this and it fate meaning that it it actually helps the cell to favor NAD recycling over methylation and excretion so Studies have also shown that green tea and regular consumption is green tea extract also reduces blood pressure cholesterol and also various other anti-inflammatory markers so it also has a whole host of other extended health benefits so next on the ingredients list is alpha lipoic acid which is often referred to as ala now ala is a natural compound that helps to boost NAD in two levels and so basically the two ways that it does this is firstly it activates a cellular energy sensor called ampk which is seen here and what ampk does is it leads to increased NAD Levels by actually activating the nampt enzyme now this pathway here this ampk nampt link is actually the same pathway that promotes The Beneficial effects of exercising and fasting the other way that ala works is down here it actually converts or promotes the conversion of nadh to NAD so remember I said at the start the NAD consists in two forms and actually the ratio of of nadh to NAD is incredibly important and as we get older the ratio tends to drift towards nadh which is unfavorable so what happens is there is an enzyme nq01 which actually oxidizes nadh back to the favorable NAD and restores the ratio and ala is known to activate this enzyme here so again as with many of our other ingredients ala also has extra benefits and it's known to be incredibly important in um antioxidant effects and it does this by activating important Cellular Defense molecules such as Nrf2 which activates glutathione and other antioxidant fences in the body and another thing to to just mention here is that um a lot of supplements that contain ala if you look at the back they contain a 50 50 mix um of you'll see it labeled as R ala and Sala so basically our ala is the natural form of ala and Sala is the unnatural or synthetic form however there are numerous studies that have shown that only the r or the natural form can be used by our body and actually the S form has no effect so in our product we do not use a 50 50 mix we only use the r ala so this is the highest quality ala that you can get that actually has the benefits so the other ingredient that we have is parsley powder and obviously this has a lot of culinary benefits but um it actually also contains multiple compounds with significant health benefits and one of these um molecules is epigenin so epigenin is scientifically proven to inhibit the inflammatory protein here cd38 so this is the one that chews up a load of NAD and it's expression you know increases several fold as we get older and just by inhibiting cd30 38 a little bit you can actually significantly increase NAD levels and parsley is known to be one of the best natural sources of epigenin and that's why we include it initiative time plus to boost NAD by reducing the activity of this cd38 consuming NAD consuming pathway and also again another benefit is that epigenin is being found to reduce anxiety and also parsley is rich in a lot of other antioxidants that protect cells from damaging free radicals which is obviously also important in anti-aging now only after fixing all of these other problems that I've mentioned in the cell is it even worth using an NAD precursor so in The Tutor Time plus we use nicotinamide as the precursor to give your cells an adequate supply of the raw material that they need to make NAD so the reason we use nicotinamide is because despite all of the hype surrounding NR and nmn all scientific data shows that the majority of NAD in the body is made from recycled nicotinamide via the Salvage pathway the body likes to make NAD out of nicotinamide and not to mention the fact that nicotinamide is actually the most bioavailable NAD precursor out of all of them now supporters of NR Ln ONN tend to use the argument that you shouldn't take nicotinamide because it's a search you inhibit search you an inhibitor but actually if you look at all of the studies that they cite all of these experiments were firstly done in vitro meaning that they were done in isolated cells in Petri dishes using very high concentrations of nicotinamide that would never usually be reached in physiological conditions found in the body because remember the body has homeostasis it doesn't let things get too out of whack before it puts them right and if you view the data even more closely what you will find is that as long as the body actually has the capacity to convert nicotinamide to NAD via the Salvage pathway nicotinamide never actually gets a chance to hang around long enough in the cells to build up to such inhibitory levels because it's rapidly converted to NAD which in turn actually activates the search ruins and you can see this by the data that I presented earlier which basically shows that nichito time plus despite containing nicotinamide actually boosts levels of activity in addition nicotinamides also got a lot of other benefits and even when inhibited therapeutic high doses for example help with skin disorders diabetes neuronal damage and also in various inflammatory diseases so finally as well as all the ingredients that I've already mentioned and we also have some of the supportive ingredients in our formulation and just to enhance the health benefits so the first one to mention is black pepper extract and the reason we put this in is because it contains the active molecule piperine so piperine is actually used to help increase the uptake of nutrients from the small intestine because it allows um various active molecules as well as the ones we include in many of the ones that we've got in our formulation to enter the blood and access the rest of the body and get to the cells more easily so this is basically added to Nigeria time plus to improve absorption of the active ingredients and piperine is also known to be beneficial because it actually boosts metabolism by activating thermogenesis and which is a process that bakes down fat cells so that's an added bonus then we've got good old vitamin C here and so we also add vitamin C because as well as have a reputation of being able to fight infections its health benefits actually start far beyond immunity so people who actually take regular doses of Vitamin C have been found to live longer than people that don't and this is likely due to the fact that it reduces inflammation it protects the Integrity of DNA and it reduces biomarkers of cellular stress and finally we've got zinc so as we age there is a progressive decline in our immune response and you know that is so relevant right now to the world that we're living in and supplementation with zinc has been helped to found reduce this impairment of the immune system so that is why it is included in uh formulation now finally just a slide on the safety and solubility of nichiro time plus and so basically we're a UK company so anichido time plus has very high high standards because we comply with all UK and EU food supplement regulations which are known to be pretty stringent and this includes the food supplements directive which basically lists the vitamins and minerals which are permitted for use in food supplements and also the recommended levels of use and all of the ingredients in the Cheeto time plus or on this list and have been assessed and approved by the European Food Safety Authority or efsa which you might know it as we also had a clinical trial which I mentioned and that had 24 people we had absolutely no adverse reactions and we've been selling the product for over a year and haven't had any adverse reactions reported the um product is vegan and gluten-free and also just to note that natito time is manufactured to really rigorous pharmaceutical standards and I think that obviously comes from my background in drug development and it's what we're used to do in and our facility follows GMP standards and is also an FDA inspected facility [Music] [Music]
