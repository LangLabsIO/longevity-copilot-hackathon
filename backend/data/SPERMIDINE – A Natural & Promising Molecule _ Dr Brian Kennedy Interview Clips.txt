[Music] aspermadine is another natural product it's produced in the body you can get it through the diet goes down with age and it was really developed by other researchers uh Frank Madeo Guido Kramer and others who've shown that it activates autophagy in the body and we've never played with it one of the things I do in my lab a lot especially with natural products is try to validate some of the things that are out there in the literature and get a feel for working with it in animal models before we start testing it in humans some things were not so good at validating but spermadine uh looks like it's the real deal at least in our hand so we can we see a lifespan extension with it although we only did a few mice for survival so it's not well powered but our data is consistent with the data in the literature and we found that it's very protective for mice on a high fat diet so that's exciting when you consider that many people are eating unhealthy high fat diets and uh a molecule like this may be more beneficial at least metabolically for people with unhealthy diets and unhealthy Lifestyles than people that are exercising a lot so um that's just speculation but but our data suggests spermidine is maybe efficacious and that's I think that's on the market as well what we'd like to do is to choose many different interventions uh small molecule supplements a couple drugs even and then also some lifestyle interventions because what I'd like to do you know many companies are trying their favorite molecule and um I think that's fine that's they're you know they're incentivized to do that we'd like to take an agnostic approach where we're comparing different interventions and see which ones work the best in which populations and and so to do that we'll do smaller studies per intervention but we'll study many different kinds of interventions and then try to see which ones work the best and certainly spermatine would be on that list we haven't resolved the the order of studies beyond the three I told you but that's certainly one that I think is worth looking into in more detail [Music] thank you foreign
