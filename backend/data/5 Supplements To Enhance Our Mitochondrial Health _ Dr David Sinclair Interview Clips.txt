[Music] we want to take supplements that protect the dna want a lot of free radical damage you don't want broken chromosomes and we also want to boost the repair systems mitochondria are key to that that one of the most important parts of a nerve cell uh or the mitochondria we have thousands in each cell and in the brain and in muscle they're really important because our nerve cells need a lot of energy to work with time as you get older those mitochondria are less active and you start to get brain fog and you know cells don't work work as well and eventually they lose their their identity and so some of the supplements that i take are aimed at boosting my mitochondrial activity so the first one first one we can talk about is metformin is a drug to treat type 2 diabetes and lower blood sugar and the way it works is it inhibits what's called complex one it's a it's a group of proteins involved in energy production and it it stops them from working efficiently in response the cell says oh my goodness i don't have enough energy i'm going to make more mitochondria so mitochondria you can think of them as bacteria they used to be bacteria that swam around outside our cells and then we merged them about four billion years ago what we try to do is we with metformin we inhibit them a little bit so that they multiply to compensate and so metformin will boost the amount of mitochondria the number of mitochondria in your cells and has been shown to improve memory in uh in elderly people now the other supplement that i take every day is coq10 part of this electron transport chain and the levels decline with age but they also decline when you take certain drugs in my case i take a statin um a torvastatin for my cholesterol familial it's a family issue and cookie10 is very important and curcutin's been shown to be important for stating off diseases like depression and that tends to happen increasingly as you get older and so supplementing that is important for cell function and for mental health um one other one that i take is alpha lipoic acid i did my phd on and you would have seen it's up on the shelf there the little molecules is important for the enzymes that that make mitochondria function and lipoic acid actually is like a little murder in proteins that spins around and you make less of it as you get older i take um a regular sized supplement one of those capsules that you can buy every day and i've been doing that now for about 15 years and i was actually told to well recommended to do that by a guy called denim harman who invented the free radical theory of aging he still worked in 92 yeah and he's my hero and i i gave a talk at his institute and uh if he tells me to do something or recommend something i'm going to do it i've been doing it ever since um and it's been really great and my mental health by the way has steadily improved with these changes carnitine is a a version of an amino acid that's important for the body's metabolism and that if you're deficient in it you just have less ability to generate energy and maintain mitochondria so taking it with alas is really important the other one i think we should mention is called pqq is a super potent antioxidant and it's been shown to boost the levels of a protein called um neuron growth factor and in this case it also stimulates the mitochondria so all of these things that we've talked about works can work together to maintain the energetics and the survival of your neurons in old age [Music] you
