[Music] so [Music] well there are supplements that uh i take and i i say in full disclosure i'm not a doctor so i don't recommend anything but i do uh believe in the science and what the science says from my lab and others is that there are ways to take certain supplements that could lengthen lifespan so in my book i list it all out on page 304 so if we don't get just to go through each one people can check it out but the main ones that we've worked on that i take every day you mentioned resveratrol i still take that since 2004 and i'm still alive and it's been shown in are now many clinical studies in humans and countless male studies that it protects against inflammation and cancer and alzheimer's so it's it's a good one um the other one that i take is an nad booster so nad is a chemical that's in our body that is needed for chemical reactions without it we're dead in 30 seconds but we make less of it as we get older and so nmn is a molecule stands for nicotinamide mononucleotide so i take that to raise my energy levels to where they were when i was young and the reason for that is that the enzymes that i study called sirtuins are they work to turn on the body's defenses against aging and as we get older because there's not enough this nad fuel for them they do less work and so the idea which has been worked out in mice but not proven in people yet is that by raising those energy levels uh my body will fight aging like it did when i was young and that includes diseases of aging and again you know well i'm still alive um and the clinical trials are in progress so i'm hoping to have some positive results to talk about um probably by the end of the year well i'm glad you brought up nad because i'm a big uh nr fan right so um an nad a pr for for for this now and you talk about and you talk about and basically nmn a lot what is the difference between uh nmn and nr and does this like which scientifically is better because i was told i was kind of like all the research i've done is saying that nr is way more effective because it gets into your system easier because of the smaller molecules that all right well i don't want to jump into a legal fight here um there are some there are vested interests involved although i don't sell any supplements so you can trust me as a scientist uh so the the way it works is that and i did okay so nr is a is a molecule similar to vitamin b3 um and the body turns it into animen and then nmn is turned into nad and nad is the one you want so they're very similar they're just both precursors to nad and the body will convert both into nad uh i've done or helped supervise enough clinical trials that i know nmn will raise nad levels um one and a half to twofold in the bloodstream of people without any any negatives so without any question i haven't tested nr side by side so i can't get into saying scientifically which one's better but i can say nmn works both in the mouse studies that we've done and the human clinical trials for raising nad and this debate about which one's better because one raises nad and the other one doesn't get into the body well i know that that's wrong because i've seen clinical trials for the past two and a half years what we need to have really is side-by-side studies of the two molecules in our and nanomen given to mice and given to humans and to look at the outcomes you know other benefits um until any of those are done and they haven't been um i think it's it's premature to be claiming one's better than the other oh i i have no idea that you're in a legal battle i'm sorry i didn't mean to make it uncomfortable no i'm not it's just a highly litigious space and there's a lot of vested interests in that area i'm i'm not selling anything so i think i'm just going by the data there are also some professors who are involved with selling supplements that have strong personalities um they're on social media if you ever want to check them out um but yes who are they going to write them down it's a hot topic well because you know like you know i live in l.a and uh nad is like a v you know people get all the nad drips and you know those are two those iv drips is like a really big thing and um you know i've been hearing about and you know i hear about nad all the time i've been taking i've been taking it for two years you know longer maybe even and i never even heard of nmn before you know until you know a friends of mine were talking about you and i was like what's the differences and it's like hard to even say nr how i can't pronounce that and mnn like there's so i didn't realize there's all these other like legalities around it um do you think the iv works or no uh well i would love to see some publications um and you always need these placebo controls because it's it's very easy to feel better after something's given to you so that's the scientist in me talking that i don't know the answer but i can tell you an anecdote if you want um a pretty funny one for what that's worth um so i i went to a well it's a story it may make you chuckle that's about it but i went to a a very famous person from hollywood who uh i won't say the name of because i don't think they'd appreciate it but someone who's been on tv for you know many many years as well as movies and so i was at their place and they said why don't you try this nad injection from my doctor so i talked to the doctor who was there at the house and i went by the next morning it was early i was feeling pretty rotten 7 30 in the morning and i had i suffered for over a year of having a spasm or i would say continual cramp in my piriformis muscle which is one that goes through your the hole in your bone uh because i wrote a book and i was sitting down for two years and i i didn't exercise much and i could barely walk i was limping and i'd been limping for a year with a lot of pain and i went to get this injection and it was straight into that into the muscle nearby the piriformis and i didn't i didn't think it would work and i said here's the skeptic in me i'll do it for the sake of my friend because they really want me to uh and i felt tingly i felt that there was something going on i walked out um that afternoon i was at the airport flying home and i was almost skipping in the way i was walking and i couldn't figure out what was different and it took me a lot of thought as to real to realize that that pain had gone away and it stayed away it's never come back and that's despite me doing physiotherapy and exercise and massage to try and get rid of this pain it wouldn't go away this one injection seemed to be the answer really and that was just an nad injection yeah it was but it's you know all all my professor uh colleagues please don't judge me i'm not saying that was a clinical trial and i'm not even saying that's proof of anything uh but it is curious that is so art do you get these do you get these nad ivs then and all these other type of like how do you take are you taking a supplement or how are you doing it now yeah i'm taking anime capsules that [Music] that are similar to the ones used in the clinical trial wow so okay can i ask you a question also in your book i you also talk about it and my doc one of my doctors once um um wrote a prescription for metaformin and you talk about it metaform and also like what does metaformin do and why are why should people take it and do you still take it um i take it maybe a few days a week um i really think it's got a good chance of being a longevity drug there are studies of tens of thousands of people who have taken metformin for their type 2 diabetes for their high blood sugar and those people actually are on average longer lived than people who don't even take the drug and don't have type 2 so that that's stunning uh the other thing is you can look at their cancer rates heart disease alzheimer's and frailty and those go down as well in the high-risk groups so i'm pretty convinced that metformin's going to be helpful beyond type 2 diabetes so i take it a couple of times maybe a few times a week with food now the reason i don't take it more times is two twofold one is i'm very sensitive to it my stomach feels uh sick when i take it that's why i have to have it with food the other reason is that it seems to reduce your ability to to lift weights um and and build up muscle and i'm in the process of trying to get my body back into shape really exercising on days that i don't take metformin why is that i wonder why would that happen well the simplest explanation i can give is that metformin interferes with your mitochondria's ability to make energy and that chemical is called atp so if you're you're not making as much chemical energy you're going to feel more tired so you might do you know let's say i'm doing um arm curls i'll do instead of 100 i'll do 80. that that would be the issue um and then really you you don't get the benefits yeah so okay so why would that can be okay so i've got a bunch of questions just on that so why are people not why don't people know about this like my the doctor who like prescribed it to me um is like a longevity doctor or whatever and i didn't take i didn't know anything about it really so i kind of just took myself off of it like i took it for a couple of weeks i'm like oh screw this i don't even know what this is and then i saw i saw it in your book and you know people like a lot of my friends who are super well educated on this stuff are taking it why are why is not more people talking about some of these things and why are not more people taking that uh well most doctors are reticent to prescribe a medicine if you don't get a disease haven't had the disease yet uh and so there's a relatively arbitrary line that says this is type 2 diabetes above that hba1c uh you've got the disease but if you're below it right you don't have a disease which i find a crazy way to practice medicine i assume that it's mostly based on cost and reimbursement that you can't just hand out medicines but on the other hand metformin is very cheap it costs a few cents a day it's available in other countries over the counter um to anybody oh it is yeah it's just uh mostly it's the western world that regards it as a drug and uh but yeah it's a very safe one it's one of the world's safest medicines it's on the list of the world health organizations essential medicines for humanity but to your question most doctors uh won't give you a drug unless you have a disease that that the drug is designed for and so but if it's going to help with longevity what is the the correlation then you can't really do weights oh you can't really work out on it resist you can't really do resistance training on it it's kind of like uh it's kind of like an oxymoron right like so what are people supposed to do is it just on the days that you take it you can't do it i mean yeah i mean you can do anything it's not a big deal you maybe have it's only a small change five percent in in your muscle size but in that study those muscles were just as strong and there was less inflammation in the muscle so unfortunately what happens and i see this every day as a scientist out comes a study nobody reads it nobody even bothers looking at the graphs someone in in writers or ap puts out a press release or the university does and it becomes dogma and there's almost no way to reverse that um and you know i'm doing podcasts occasionally but that's not reaching you know the hundreds of millions of people that you'd need to reach to be able to turn this around my book is helping i think i'm getting a lot of good feedback about that but it's still hard to reach most people who don't read um still um so ultimately it's really up to the media to correctly interpret science but that takes a lot of work and they have to put out stories every day um and they don't have the time like i do to actually read a paper before writing about it but you're doing such great things it's such cool things i mean um so if we can just if we can kind of just bounce back and forth here to the reversal of aging so does metaforming help with age is it it may help you live longer but does it help reverse the aging does that do yeah that's a an unknown there's some there's a study where just a short course i think was a week of metformin uh maybe even less a few days reversed the clock but that's to me that that that's a bit hard to believe i'd like to see that reproduce there was another study that was done that was super interesting um was it greg thay he was a professor and steve horvath at ucla they gave a cocktail to people and it was metformin uh is a growth hormone and dhea and uh and they got an age reversal of two and a half years on average now these aren't big changes um so i don't think metformin is going to turn the clock back 50 something like that i think you need this technology that i was describing where we really can reset the clock [Music] you
