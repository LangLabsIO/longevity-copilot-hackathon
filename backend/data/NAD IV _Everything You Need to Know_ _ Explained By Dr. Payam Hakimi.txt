[Laughter] [Music] nad has become known as the miracle molecule why what is nad how does it work who can benefit from nad and what are the side effects of nad hello i'm dr payam hikimi we've used nadiv in our practice for a long time with a lot of patients and we have seen amazing results with it and i want to share some of that results with you now as we age the amount of nad in the body starts dropping and you guessed it what's going to happen is the toxins are going to stay in the cell the cell is not going to be able to function the way it was supposed to it's not going to produce hormones as much as it did in the past and what happens is inflammation and toxins stay in the cell and that's when we call it cell aging cell death and that becomes our aging as well and that's why nad has been called the miracle molecule because with its function with producing energy or helping produce energy the cells are able to do everything that they need to do and clear themselves so in a way it's anti-aging or reversing aging all of us have heard that 40 is the new 30. i'm going to extend that and say 50 is the new 40 and 60 is the new 50. with using the anti-aging protocols with ivs with the ivs that we combine together and supplements and obviously exercise diet detoxification and everything else we can actually reverse some of the aging that has happened in our body or at least make sure that we don't age as fast now i'm gonna give you some facts about nad and i'm gonna do my best not to be boring nad is synthesized from vitamin b3 which is niacin and from amino acids tryptophan and aspartate it's been used since 1960s for alcohol and drug withdrawals and recently again it resurfaced for you for the same reasons for alcohol drug withdrawals as well as for parkinson's and alzheimer's so it's being studied for that as well and some physicians have had great experience with using nad nad has been shown to reduce stress depression and anxiety scores as well as it's been used as a detoxification method for patients who've been on long-term anti-depressants anxiolytics pain medications as well as obviously alcohol and drugs that we talked about so it seems that it might have a rejuvenating effect on the brain cells it also helps a lot with sort of mental clarity people who get it actually say that they have a better uh sort of focus they have better attention span sleep gets better with using nad properly obviously if the dose of leds too much obviously it will have the opposite effect and i'll as as i get the iv i'll show you what it feels like because if you overdo nad it actually creates a lot of anxiety in the body it improves the markers of metabolic issues like obesity cardiac issues insulin resistance resistance to lose weight it actually helps a lot of our athletes with their athletic performance it helps to put on a little bit of muscle and and lose some of the fat that's inside the body it helps with recovery and pain after a workout in that same essence is also used with people who have chronic fatigue syndrome because remember nad gives a little bit of energy as well as takes away some of the pain from the body and helps the cells clear out themselves and that's one of the conditions one of the issues with chronic fatigue syndrome so it's been really good with our patients who have chronic fatigue syndrome or any of the other uh viral issues like epstein-barr virus or lyme's disease again it does not treat any of these conditions but it it gives the energy it gives a better mood it takes away some of the pain so it actually helps our patients a lot it's also been suggested that nad helps with our immune system again it goes with the same physiology if it's helping the cells in our body to function better function faster with more energy and and get rid of the toxins much easier and much faster we can appreciate that those sim systems and or those organs are going to work better and the same goes with a liver liver detoxification we actually use nad as part of our liver detoxification ivs with our patients nad has antioxidant properties so in essence it also works as an anti-inflammatory and animal studies have shown this anti-oxidant property anti-inflammatory property and the fact that it increases the stress response in the body one of the reasons we call nad an anti-aging molecule is because we know it helps in the processes that repair the dna in our body those of you who are familiar with telomeres and have been studying those know that as telomeres change obviously our lifespan changes as well there are no documented adverse reactions from nad and as a matter of fact it's used as i mentioned earlier for parkinson's alzheimer's and alcohol drug withdrawal very high doses and multiple days in a row like 10 to 14 days in a row we have not seen any adverse reactions in the body however i will show you uh as i'm getting the iv what does it feel like i get nads myself all the time and i recommend other iv nutritions and amino acids with nad because it helps to balance out the body cleanse out the body to drive in multivitamins and minerals inside the cells as well as to use glutathione even to help out with detoxification and anti-oxidation so we have put together a group of protocols with multiple ivs in a row where a patient can get and it will help out a lot with the symptoms that and the conditions that i talked about earlier so as i promised i wanted to show you a um the iv nad and and as someone is getting it how does it feel as you can see i'm connected to the nad nad is a clear molecule itself and it's a normal saline so there's no color other ivs that you're going to see or another iv that you're going to see i'm going to get right after this which we connect to the same line is going to have color because that has vitamins minerals and i'll tell you all the ingredients uh that's inside but nad as you can see uh is dripping and i'm going very slow because i promise to tell you what it feels like as i'm getting it with this rig which is a slower rate it feels good it's a little bit energizing and and some of our patients including myself the vision gets a little bit clearer and the mental activity becomes a little bit easier right away as we get it and then i want to bring your attention to i'm gonna increase the uh the drip rate a little bit so i'm gonna increase it and and the reason i'm gonna do that is you've heard probably from ben greenfield and and other people who have who could get the iv nad but they get it in a very high rate and we have some of our patients that do the same thing so with a higher rate what happens is the heart rate goes up a little bit and i'm going to increase this slowly so that you see as as i'm increasing it my heart rate goes up a little bit and i mean it's not bad obviously i can handle it and i can have a conversation with you the palms get a little bit sweaty and then as i increase this a little bit more now i start feeling that my heart rate is going a little bit faster and don't feel flushed yet i'll go a little bit higher um so at this point for me it feels like my heart rate is going faster and i'm sweating and you can probably tell from the way i'm talking that it's a little bit um it feels like a rush and some people like this rush and and obviously it's been uh sort of shown on on different channels that people do this but we recommend the regular and i tell all my patients and they all have this control and they control the amount that is comfortable for them and you see it so fast as soon as i decrease it a little bit all that symptoms all the symptoms that was there basically goes away and it sort of gets back to a normal rate so that was managing nad in our office and and sort of how our patients we have our patients uh use this nad has been used uh in our office very successfully with people who have chronic fatigue syndrome people who have anxiety disorders depressions we have been able to decrease a lot of our patients uh antidepressants and in certain cases even stop their antidepressants not by nad alone and and again i don't want this to sound like nad's doing all this job when we when we get a patient and look at their physiology we look at their hormones we look at their um brain physiology their serotonin dopamine gaba glutamine we look at all all these hormones including their testosterone their thyroid dhea these are important hormones in the body so once we figure out where all these numbers are and we figure out exactly what we need to do with the patient we use a combination of supplements iv nutrition that will help out with brain physiology detoxifying the liver decreasing inflammation in the body and giving our patients energy sometimes having a little bit more energy and um having some nad in the body basically gets a person out of this mood of being tired and and sometimes just being tired a lot of us can sort of feel as if we're depressed right so combination of sufferings combination of iv nutrition nad along with other iv nutritions you're going to see right after this i'm going to get another ib and you're going to see it's going to help and not in one session obviously again this is a protocol that we have with our patients we've used these protocols many times and it has worked for us and we use it with specific patients not all patients can come off of antidepressants don't want to make that promise for anxiolytics i don't want to make that promise to you but we have been successful so far with most of our patients to either stop their antidepressants or even slow down or decrease the amount of antidepressants they're taking so right after we get an iv nad we also do a bag full of different vitamins minerals as i talked about earlier on this specific bag that you guys see is called body of harmony f1 i made it specifically for myself a while back and it's full of amazing ingredients i don't want to give the secret out but those who have received f1 know that it feels like f1 and combining nad and f1 back to back you actually feel the effect for the next three four or five days uh the effects stays there shiva my wife and i get this iv on usually on fridays so friday saturday sunday becomes obviously a an amazing weekend shiva practices mindful meditation as well as consciousness expansion and reprogramming and she states that whenever she gets this iv is nad specifically because we know that it detoxifies the cell and we know specifically that it works in the brain area a lot more so she feels that the iv leds help her a lot with uh expansion with reprogramming and with her meditations and i do a lot of martial arts so i friday saturday sunday becomes my days to exercise a little bit more just because there's a lot of energy there i can also tell you from my own experience that after you get iv nad and a vitamin boost right after you feel energized you feel happy you sleep good cravings go away uh and and there's a lot of stamina and energy that's there and the reason is because nad makes the cells start functioning more and right away we're flooding the body flooding the blood with all these amazing vitamins and minerals that help out with the mitochondria help out with all the detoxifications and inflammation pathways of the body and of the cells so it feels great to have these two together [Music] you
