[Music] um so what are the easy we know this uh surprising uh how few people do it but i'm out there proselytizing just about every day now uh what you can do in your lives now if you want to live healthier if not certainly longer but what's not so easy well not so not so easy is trying to figure out what to do if someone cannot jump on a treadmill or cannot miss meals or cannot get a standing desk and stand up all day or cannot afford a biomarker feedback which some of us are using now essentially that's taking blood tests and having a computer tell you uh how out of range you are for your demographic for your sex for your age and how to try and get that back in order that's coming that's coming so there are biosensors on our arms there are of course watches and a ring like this that i'm wearing and that'll all help continue what richard beautifully showed in his talk um that trend going upward linearly but i would say that if we don't do something those of us in this room and our colleagues it will not continue that way it doesn't happen by accident we have to work as human beings to make that happen so what's the not so easy well there are many pathways that control aging that's been the breakthrough since 2000 well actually more like early 1990s that there are actually genetic pathways that control aging we met brian and i and lenny worked in yeast and those pathways actually have shown to be very important in our bodies as well and the challenge now is finding molecules i believe to to treat medicine treat diseases with medicines um so you can see there's there's rapid logs we've got nad boosters metformin um and uh the stacks i want to give an update on stack stacks are so two and activating compounds first one that got a lot of press was resveratrol but there are others there's quercetin which is now uh prosthetized as a synalytic there's physin also 2104 is a drug that was developed by certain glycosmith cline an update on that i think is warranted now but now for the hard one this is one of the things that drives me has been driving me since i was about four years old uh why don't we stay young and it's such an obvious question i don't think many of us even take take this question seriously um but if if aliens were to come down and examine us as a species they think we're kind of pathetic that we don't ask this question more often and we have debates about how the heck are we ever going to help help each other but yeah what about why don't we stay young another way to put it is why do we age now we thanks to you know brian put out a beautiful uh paper which we all cite uh all the time uh this is a classic paper from a number of years ago the hallmarks of aging and you know eight or nine depending on which continent you're on and we all use this as a guideline to hopefully one day extend healthy lifespan with all of these is there is there something upstream is there something that's that's driving many if not all of these processes and so these are these are nine dams on nine tributaries as a way to say maybe if we could go really upstream maybe there's something could really have a big effect on aging and and maybe even if we understood it well enough we could truly reverse age not just improve blood flow and and that kind of thing that we've been doing [Music] you
