so so [Music] so we're using the the what's called the the yamanaka factors and so the first uh sure well the the first person to use these factors was uh shinya yamanaka a japanese scientist who looked through a lot of different genes and found a set of four factors that if you put them into an adult cell say skin cell they would go back to being very primitive so primitive what we call a pluripotent stem cell that you could then turn those cells into a nerve cell or even regrow an eye in the dish it was a breakthrough that led to the nobel prize being awarded to him in 2012. you just take a person's skin cell and turn it into a neuron i mean that why not i mean a high school student can do that these days it's not that difficult once typically with science once you know how something works it's pretty easy same with aging i think but what we've just discovered is that um and first of all i want to give a lot of credit to someone at the sulk whose name is juan carlos belmonte a professor a good friend of mine and he's uh and he did the experiment that we were trying to do uh so we were just slightly scooped on that but he made a mouse where he could turn on these four yamanaka genes and for short they stand for o s k and m and that mouse uh when he switched them on died within a couple of days so that's not great for those mice but what he then cleverly did was he didn't give up or his his postdoc didn't give up what he did was he turned the jeans on for a couple of days and then stopped let the mice recover for a few days and then turn them back on and so they you know i feel for the mice because they were headed towards death and they could recover and then they cycled but actually they ended up being healthier the premature aging miles model that he had uh lived i think it was 40 plus percent longer but also he's shown since then that you can use these factors to improve wound healing and kidney healing so was he boosting their stem cells pools and their what so he was like regenerating tissue what i think he's doing is what we're doing in the lab which is getting those proteins that have moved around and lost their way to go back to where they were when they were young and then reset the methylation clock and now a cell doesn't just think it's using crispr it's literally young no he well he might have but it was a transgenic mouse which means he inserted those four genes into the mouse's genome yeah with an on off switch yeah okay uh we don't do that we we use uh viruses that we can give to old mice he has to start from a single egg we can go into old mice and within a few weeks figure out if we've reversed aging in a tissue in the whole house and we've also discovered that it's best if you don't use all four of those factors we have to leave one of those off because it's toxic it's the mick gene mick is an oncogene but the other three work great and the results that came in through the text today use those three genes to protect neurons from dying in the mouse but also in the dish and that the gene that can restore the met the horvath clock was required and so we're very close i think to to seeing the future of where maybe eventually we don't use viruses maybe we have molecules that can do this that we can put in a drip or in a pill that can send us back another 20 years wow that's super exciting i'm i'm like very pumped up about this whole epigenetic clock research and linking it to you know basically like being able to reverse reverse aging i mean i think that do you know um is there any evidence that fasting has any effect on that epigenetic clock has that been shown you know uh i have not seen that um i think it what i've seen from steve's work and others is that you can slow the rate of the clock but i haven't seen reversal yet and i've shown steve the results i just told you and he's pretty excited that someone's figured out we think we've figured out why the clock ages what's causing it but also what's the first reset that's ever been found but i i would suspect that fasting can help but probably it's not enough to really do what these powerful genes are doing one day we'll we'll figure it out but so fasting i still do that as much as i can for one main reason and that is that it's going to activate these defenses that at least slow down and somewhat stabilize the epigenome decay that we call uh and but we're probably going to need something more potent to really go back 20 years but do we do we slow down aging uh by fasting and running absolutely no question [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] you
