so so [Music] it's good um and i take um actually alpha lipoic acid yeah and one of the actually the thing that turned me onto that was uh i spoke to denim harmon's family so denim harmon you may know him he's the father of the oxidative stress theory of yeah and and so he i i was fortunate to win an award with his name on it and i went out there and his family were very generous to host me and he was still alive at the time he passed four a few years ago but he was still healthy and going into work at 92 and so i said what is what's his secret oh lipoic acid i thought well at the very least it didn't hurt him so again that that i take it every day yeah it's if you understand what it does it's basically one of the most powerful antioxidants that helps boost glutathione which detox fire it's anti-inflammatory it helps your mitochondria it helps detoxify from metals it it sort of uh helps with blood sugar and diabetics it helps with diabetic neuropathy i mean it's a really well studied molecule yeah and it's all about the mitochondria well yeah i would say that too i'm taking off alpha lipoic acid how many how much me too 500 at least five yeah it's about 500 i guess okay yeah got it so i'm doing ala one gram morning and night for my body weight i'm about in two or five right now uh so my kids are getting it once a day uh it's just in the morning they didn't use to get it but i've added it in recently yeah well it's actually it seemed to be helpful uh for viral infections yeah i didn't realize that oh and you know how um i think a lot of people would have read in the new york times or elsewhere that a loss of smell is a potential symptom of of covert 19. and i looked up what what's the cure or what's a potential cure for that and it was alpha lipoic acid which was great news because i was already taking it nice and i'll tell you very briefly why i started taking it there's a there was a scientist who's now unfortunately passed away but he was his name is denim harman and he was known for the free radical theory of raging famous gay and yeah i managed to meet at least his family he was in his 90s um and at home when i visited but they said his family let me in on a little secret which was that denim has been taking had been taking this alpha lipoic acid for years most of his life mostly thinking that it was an antioxidant and he worked until his early 90s and so i figured well if it didn't hurt him n equals one guinea pig but it was a really smart guinea pig i like that uh what what about uh with within alpha point acid there's the normal cheap stuff there's our there's also our alpha lipoic acid which is racemic and the first guy to launch that came to be in i wanna say 2000 before anyone knew what i was doing and we talked about launching something and then there's also potassium or alpha lipoic acid do you go for the fancy stuff or the cheap stuff uh mine's the l so just the bulk cheap the cheap stuff okay cool is it am i wasting my money i don't think you're wasting your money but there's there's more efficacy from the r versus s form [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] you
