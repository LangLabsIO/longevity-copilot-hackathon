[Music] expert on that i'm gonna ask you another question that might be controversial based on a couple of previous um doctors that i've had on i had dr roger patrick on and i asked her i said hey what are some of the the healthy foods that are marketed as healthy that in your opinion aren't as healthy as they claim to be essentially was the question i asked and she said grapes have a lot of sugar in them that spike my blood pressure i think she wears like a glucose monitor so she's monitoring all of her food and constantly testing it she said when i was eating grapes like my glucose levels went way up skyrocketed and i realized that that's not good for the body to have you know grapes a lot of grapes and you can transition into having blueberries or something else that might be better for the nutritional benefits i put that online and people slam me for that and then uh dr gundry said that he doesn't think uh you know modified apples the way they are now how we modify them how they're so big how they're full of so much sugar he's like i don't think that's good to have these big apples that are modified because of the sugar and the fructose in these big apples like a honey crisp or something and he was saying we should be having a lot less fruit because of the fructose levels what's your thoughts on fruit in general should we be eating fruits every day is it something with you know i've been hurt in the past like we only used to have fruits right before the winter to kind of store up the fat and in a seasonal thing there's a lot of fruit eaters out there that believe in eating fruits only fruit all day i'm just trying to find the answers i don't know the truth of the matter but what's your thoughts based on research so research we don't research fruits of course but we do research the effects of sugar on the body uh and it's not good so try it and is that all sugar or is that fruit sugar or refined sugar what's do we know that well there's glucose and fructose okay so it doesn't really matter where you get it these are just chemicals that's the same chemical wherever you get it from glucose you need glucose right we again we die without glucose but the foods in in our world are so full of sugars that we're constantly feeding ourselves uh more sugar than we ever would have experienced even just a hundred years ago or 50 even um so where do i come down on this well let me tell you from my own experience it's probably better to give you my example yes and preach to others yes um i definitely like fruit and i eat fruit and i encourage it with my kids for sure uh but they're it's a it's a balance you want the most nutrition and vitamins uh and and the lower amount of sugar and on a scale of of that ratio i think rhonda patrick's right that grapes have more sugar than nutrition compared to other fruits so the types of fruits that i like to have are ones that have lots of polyphenols colored fruits such as blueberries blackberries those things you don't want to eat too many of them of course because then you you're basically eating tons of sugar anyway but yeah blueberries i would have in a yogurt in the morning if i had had some right um the other fruit that i think is worth looking at is cantaloupe or rock melon that i believe has the most nutrition versus sugar of any fruit so we try to eat those kind of uh melons as well you know what watermelon probably isn't in that category but we still eat it in summer the the point in my family and in my life is uh we're not so strict that that we avoid every type of food but most of the time i try to focus on on plants i think that it's born out just looking at people who live a long time and cultures that have a lot of elderly people over 100 the type of foods they eat typically have a lot more plant um than just pure meat and i'm gonna get hate meal as well from the carnivores but it's important people know i'm not saying don't eat meat i'm just saying the kind of balance if you want to focus on types of foods for longevity that's what the data says gotcha do you know if um the people in the the blue zones who are living over a hundred are they are they eating i'm hearing you say they eat more plant-based are they eating lots of meat lots of fruit as well or are they limiting intake on some of those areas well they seem to do all the right things so it's it don't eat a lot on the island of okinawa they tend to stop eating when they're only 70 full which is a very good idea it's like i i keep eating until i'm 70 percent over full yeah then you can regret then i regret it but you're like oh yeah but you also you you work out more than i train hard yeah yeah uh they tend to eat the right types of foods which are packed with these polyphenols these little chemicals that are found in plants when particularly when those plants are stressed out they don't eat a lot of processed foods which kills a lot of these vitamins and polyphenols as well they colored foods which which as i mentioned is is a good thing they tend to have good social life they tend to move a lot they do gardening they do walking as they get older these are all things that just make a lot of sense anyway [Music] you
