[Music] uh so we need stem cells they're producing new cells all the time we know a lot about it in the skin when you lose stem cells your hair goes gray you lose hair production your skin starts to wrinkle you get thinning of the skin um for another example would be uh let's see what's a good one so stem cell therapies are replacing parts of joints and whatever because you lose the ability to to fix the joints if you wear them out um the problem with stem cells replacement though is it's often hard to get them to go where they belong especially in complex tissues like the eye but they're very important without them you know we're not going to survive for very long but what we're working on in my lab is to try and reverse the age of those stem cells so that they don't die and that you don't need to replace them and we had this paper in nature in december showing that we could rejuvenate cells and we're now looking at rejuvenating all those cells in the body not just uh the eye cells but until then i think stem cells are really important the the other thing that you the audience may not know is that you can take a skin cell from a person and make that a stem cell now and grow new tissues new skin even small mini organs that one day can replace the ones you have in my lab we're making mini brains and studying them for alzheimer's disease and reversal of aging in those yet what we don't know though is how important is it if you just reverse the age of stem cells and stem cells alone is that sufficient um i'm sure it's necessary but is it sufficient we i don't think we know that yet [Music] [Music] you
