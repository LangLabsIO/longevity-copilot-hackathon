[Music] right well so just uh update on sirtuins they were discovered first in yeast uh and then are named after the gene sir two silent information regulator number two uh and information is the important part because information i believe uh is or the loss of information is the problem during aging and that's both genetic and epigenetic information and certi-6 uh is one of seven sirtuins that protects the cell and there are three of them that protect uh things that go on in the nucleus to do with the dna and the epigenome and 36 and 31 seem to be the most important for that they repair dna and they control gene expression as well as other things like retrotransposons these hitchhikers in our genome but surgery 6 seems to be the most potent slash important because when you turn it on or give extra copies in mice you get a robust lifespan extension 31 hasn't been successful shin mi at wash you has shown that certio1 in the brain can extend lifespan but the transgenic didn't seem to extend lifespan and for reasons that we think have to do with the pituitary but long story short the 36 is exciting we've we're working on molecules that activate 36 i have a startup company with john denu and lenny guaranty working on that um and so it's it's super exciting i know heim has a similar company and if we could activate 36 we could improve metabolism down regulate hyperinflation and even treat cancer we think [Music] you
