[Music] foreign evity Gene it's it's a protein there that belongs to the Saturn family of enzymes they are a class of proteins involved in many different cellular processes regulating gene expression DNA repair metabolism and cert6 in particular plays a very significant role in regulating cellular functions related to DNA stability and metabolism so Celtics involved in repairing DNA damage which is extremely important to aging helps to maintain genomic stability by promoting the repair of DNA double strand breaks and other forms of DNA damage cert6 has been heavily linked to life extension there are you know it's often associated with mechanisms related to aging and age-related diseases Professor virgovanova took a group of mice increased the expression of certain six in those mice and they live they're around 30 longer they also tried removing cert6 from another group of mice and those mice got sick and died a lot sooner in humans we have plenty of evidence as well people that lived to over 100 years old are still healthy and active have very high set sex activity so we know it's vital for human aging it's also has anti-inflammatory properties it can suppress the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines which is beneficial for reducing inflammation related diseases which again we know that inflammation affects most diseases it's a key driver aging so this is where we get a lot of the longevity benefits from the mice trial that was conducted by Professor very wilbon over and her team showed that cert6 activator a natural supplement drastically reduced those inflammatory cytokines and again increased healthy lifespan is also associated with cancer biology so it can act as a tumor suppressor by inhibiting the growth and proliferation of cancer cells and then obviously dysregulation of cert6 has been linked to the increase of certain types of cancer so we actually have a human trial where we're doing at the moment with cert6 activator to the idea is that we want to prove that certix activator it reduces the reoccurrence of cancer [Music] search activator is the only way to guarantee that you are activating your set six it's it's the best way to activate your search six there's only one ingredient it is derived from seaweed so it's 100 natural and it is the most popular ingredient that do not age.org provides [Music] so every batch is sent for testing to check cert6 monoribosylation activity and this is done at the Rochester aging Research Center which is in [Music] I think I've already answered this one but um the mousetrah's already completed incredible results that's being published September of 2023 so stay uh you know keep your eyes open for our emails but we'll link to that study in those vastly so it showed that certix activator vastly extended lifespan there's less disease Etc and the trial actually lasted a lot longer than we planned because the mouse taking asserts exactly to live for so long in fact I think one of them is still alive at some point you just have to end the study well nobody needs anything I think it's all about desire if you're happy with aging just like your older relatives did then you don't need to do anything but if your goal is to extend healthy lifespan then the first supplement you should take is six activator activating citum one is also important it's commonly regarded as the second most important so to interactivate but cert6 is by far and away the most important [Music] when taking cersex activator do not age members report feeling more energy healthier Clarity of thinking like a sharper mind but I think you know the most important piece of feedback we can get is that it certain activator is the most popular ingredient it's it's the one that most people are using and I think that speaks volumes so the dosage guidance that we give is weight dependent so most people take either two or four capsules per day and it should be taken close to a meal time but having said that something is better than nothing and daily use is better than perfectly time used that is inconsistent so provided you take it every single day you will get the benefits I think that's it thank you very much [Music] foreign
