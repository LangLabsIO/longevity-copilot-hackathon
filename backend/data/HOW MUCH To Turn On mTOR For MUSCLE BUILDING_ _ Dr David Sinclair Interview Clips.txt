[Music] well there's a real debate about how much to turn on mtor for muscle building because what you want to do is to have a decent-sized muscles and exercise muscles and very fit muscles but some of the things that i talk about such as fasting um vegan and vegetarianism um and even taking metformin can affect your ability to build up large large muscles um you can put yourself in a state of adversity and adversity in my medic we call this homesis for most of the week okay so my my case i i don't eat breakfast and i have a very small lunch if any i take metformin and i try to not take too much too much sugar and certainly not a lot of amino acids in the form of animal meat but i do i do try to maintain an adequate level um and i do skip metformin and so what i'm trying to do is to have an adversity part of my life which is most of the week but there will be days where i exercise and i don't take metformin uh which is an abundance memetic we we can switch between adversity and abundance but not what you don't want to do in my opinion is always be in an abundance mode taking a lot of uh hormones you're trying to boost those up and particularly eating a lot of meat then your mtor which is the protein that measures how much you're eating of protein so your amino acid content is mtor mtor is what helps build up muscle when you're in abundance so that's good but you don't want it always to be on because it also protects you against aging when its levels go down so the way to bring mtor levels down is to eat less meat on some days um and and focus on plant protein which has fewer amounts of leucine and serine which are the the amino acids that regulate into um so hopefully that that that's clear that i think most of the time you should be in an in adversity mimetic of course adequate nutrition that's important it's not like we're starving for amino acids you don't want that but if you overdo it and you're filled with amino acids then it'll be an abundance state and that's bad for you long term so i think the switching is is a good plan [Music] [Music] you
