[Music] you know i've never been known for for being shy or not taking risks i i believe life is short and we all have that problem and the faster we can figure this stuff out the better for all of us um and you know there's no point in us realizing at the end of our lives we were born one or two generations too early to reap the benefit so yeah i'm in a rush i i want the world to reach the place that i know it's going to reach a world that's as different today as we are from 100 years ago in terms of medicine uh and so yeah it was an interesting journey i like to push boundaries scientifically um i think that you know i've read a lot of scientific history and you know no no theory lasts forever except maybe the second law of thermodynamics and really we're just humans trying to figure this stuff out and the more dialogue discourse new ideas you know testing those ideas the better right that's how progress is made actually that the theory began when i was uh 26 years old so it wasn't just last year that i came up with this idea but the it's been evolving um over time and i've been wanting to write down the theory in a specific journal in a formal way but i've just been too busy working on the science out there in the lab and doing other things so i it turns out just through lack of time that the book was the best way for me to express my ideas and it's unusual we were talking uh before we went on air about how rare it is that a scientist puts their work out in public their theory in a book before it's actually totally crystallized and written down in a scientific paper and vetted and that's just how history happened uh in my case but the idea has stopped began really with yeast cells we were studying yeast cells and the silent information regulators these sir proteins that we've been working on that word information has been there since the beginning going back 25 years ago and how is information tied into aging itself well in yeast it didn't take long to figure out that epigenetic changes as we call them the noise of informational noise was the cause of aging a major cause of aging and yeast but it's taken us oh the better part of two decades to test and to understand whether that was true for us and while you can do a yeast experiment in a week a mouse experiment the ones that we just put up online um not the one not the reprogramming one but a couple of others they took us 10 years those two papers and i felt like we were at a point where we had enough evidence from our research and increasingly other people who are working in this area that this hypothesis was going to come out anyway kind of like charles darwin uh would have gotten scooped if he hadn't written the origin of the species so he rushed it out the same thing was happening to me i spent 10 years going haha no no one else is uh thinking this way in terms of information but then the epigenome exploded in the aging field the horvath clock the epigenetic clock came out and i thought well i better get this out or you know i'll really regret it for the rest of my life and so it all spilled out on the pages quite beautifully i think thanks to my co-author who's a really great writer and together we produce something that that was far better than we could have produced alone but what i've been very encouraged by is the reaction of my colleagues that for many of them it just makes perfect sense if you distill down biology to its essence and ask why don't organisms live forever why isn't life permanent it's got to be information loss there's nothing else it could be [Music]
