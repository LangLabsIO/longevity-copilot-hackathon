so nam pt that nam pt enzyme is it seems like it's such a critical link because it it recycles that nicotinamide to nmn and you get more nad so when we use nad up either via parp enzymes to rip to make the flags on dna or via the sirtuins which we're going to talk more about that nad is degraded to nicotinamide i heard you say something really interesting on one on peter and tia's podcast i wonder if you still feel this way you and i thought this made so much sense you said maybe it wouldn't be a good idea to take nicotinamide and a lot of people may be taking nicotinamide as niacin quote unquote but from an enzymatic perspective if you are taking nicotinamide could that could that inhibit this it does inhibit the sirtuins in some ways because it's kind of a feedback regulator the sirtuins use nad they make nicotinamide as a byproduct so like in any reaction in chemistry if you put in if you put in things on the back end if you put in the you know the products it could inhibit the reaction is that right yeah that was the first uh big discovery that i made when i started my lab here at harvard medical school uh it's a long time ago i was only 29 years old but we what what my student did kevin bitterman who's now a famous venture capitalist uh what his first experiment was was to put nicotinamide on a plate of yeast cells and ask what happens to the sirtuins and if they're active they would be red and if they're not active the yeast would turn white or stay white and he came into my office hoping that they'd be red and he was very disappointed that they were all white and i said kevin this is fantastic news i know you haven't discovered a sort of an activator that took us another few years but he found the first so to an inhibitor and it was nicotinamide and so we published that uh in 2002 and it was really um it's become a tool if you're a scientist who wants to study what happens when the serotonins are inactive you squirt in 10 uh what is it 10 millimolar nicotinamide so that's a high level and probably our bodies clear out nicotinamide quickly we excrete it as methyl nicotinamide right but i've never taken the risk of if i look at a bottle of vitamins and it says there's a high dose of niacinamide or nicotinamide i put it back because i'm not going to take the risk that even in my throat in my mouth in my gut i'm not going to inhibit the sirtuins you really want these sir two and zen park to be as active as they can be all the time [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] you
