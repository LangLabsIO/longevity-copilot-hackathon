[Music] i'm all for keeping your hormones at young levels all about keeping the body the way it was when it was 20. uh and however you can do that and it's safe do that i'm i'm on board with hormone replacement therapy for women and men if needed that i have um tried my best to find ways in in myself i'm actually naturally higher than an average 20 year old and but naturally meaning i've worked at it exercise helped building up um i'm not as bulky as you that's for sure of it but from my basal state which was pretty puny to having some muscle uh my quads mainly big muscles back muscles as well doing um dead lifts this kind of stuff um so that helped a lot got it up to was around hovering around 500 um it's gone close to double that um over the last couple of years with changes to my diet changes with supplements but i i don't actually i can't tell you scientifically which one of those has contributed but it's steadily gone up which is good um if it had plummeted i would have stopped taking x whatever it was um but it's i'm happy with these numbers so it's just uh under near a thousand now it's shock shocking actually because i haven't done anything obvious you know you read in online what boosts testosterone i'm not doing a lot of that stuff well so you know i want to be helpful practically uh so some of the things that i do are so this fasting has helped i think that when i started well i don't call fuzzing i uh to call it one meal a day but that seemed to help and so also become giving up a lot of uh fat and a lot of meat that's not gonna sound good to everybody i know i did lose weight and that may have contributed to right i mentioned how much weight i've lost um but here's the thing i don't think it's a bad thing to supplement at all i'm not against it so it's it's an abundant signal testosterone is okay yeah times are good build muscle but then i have to look at the clinical data um and while it won't extend your lifespan and that's really clear there have been probably 50 million dollars worth of clinical trials saying that testosterone won't make you live longer um it will help you have more muscle which will prevent you falling over and breaking your bones which is a problem for most elderly but there's also not a lot of downside there's very little if any that i've seen there's not more cancer so put it this way it's not going to hurt you if you feel better and you're stronger and you look better you know by all means and this is why doctors prescribe it otherwise you know there'd be a warning but is it is it going to make you live longer it doesn't look like [Applause] [Music] [Applause] you
