[Laughter] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] i don't think it takes a genius to realize that aging is a disease by definition if you look up in the medical dictionaries what a disease is uh it's a condition that results in a deterioration of function um and that can eventually lead to death and that's exactly what aging is but for some reason i think historical reason psychologically as well we put it in a different category and it turns out that the the dividing line is simply just how many people get that disease if something happens that's horrible over time to less than 50 percent of the population we call it a disease and we try hard to treat it we sometimes we give it names like a syndrome but if it happens to more than fifty percent of us let's say even if it's just fifty point five uh we call that aging and that's just a total arbitrary cutoff you can talk about the mean lifespan the average lifespan and the maximum and we've done a very good job of preventing infections and death during childbirth and limiting wars so the the average lifespan has gone up dramatically and continues to go up almost every year with the exceptions of uh wars around 1918 and 2020 but that line will continue to go up but the maximum has not they've always been very old people around you know probably hundreds of thousands if not millions of years ago we know of one person who lived to 122 even though that's even now debated but around 1718 we we reach our maximum men a little early a few years earlier and we haven't been able to push past that barrier and some people say we never will what i say is there are plenty of species that live longer than us and they're not so biologically different than us some of them are warm-blooded and have offspring and and they've only been separated by us uh from us by a fraction of a second in geological time um and so it's not a biological barrier to living longer we just need to understand what's going on in them let's say the bowhead whale is a good example or a tortoise and apply that to us either using gene therapies or other types of medicines that could give us what they have and we lack what i write about uh in lifespan is a new theory that's you know even since i written wrote the book um has taken on a life of its own in the scientific field which is uh exciting and rewarding and that's the idea that our bodies have certain types of information you know we live in the information age so this is no longer so hard to talk about and conceive of the two types of information one's digital which is dna the other is analog which is the control systems of that dna think of it as the software of the body and what i'm proposing is that it's a glitch in the software not the actual code which is the dna which is good news uh potentially good news because if there's a reset switch that allows you to reboot the system um i mean how many of us are just turned to switching the computer on and off and restarting and it works perfectly again uh get rid of that blue screen so aging is like a blue screen and i i think there might be a reset switch that allows our bodies to be young again that would a allow us to not just prevent but treat diseases that are currently impossible to treat uh but b also allow us our bodies to function like they're young again and literally be young again so that we don't get heart disease and alzheimer's and the interesting idea if that's true if you can reset the body and you have for example alzheimer's disease does it just go away and i'm willing to bet that it does you know i i jokingly say when i give lectures uh to younger audiences med students at harvard for example that dvds and cds are these old-fashioned things that we used to put movies on and photos and i get a chuckle i think most people know what i'm talking about the the the analogy works because the dvd has the the digital system which is are the the zeros and ones the pits in the foil and that's like our genome our genome isn't zeros and ones it's four chemicals atcg for short but it is it is digital uh it's base four not base 2 based and so what we can think of is that this digital format is the information that we inherit from our parents genetics but there's another form of information which we call epigenetics which in the cell are the systems that read the genes correctly but in the dvd analogy it's the reader of the dna of the dvd so that you know remember you have to have a blue laser that reads the dvd um and that's analog right it's it still has to move around it's not digital uh at least the machinery isn't and it can get screwed up a number of ways so the the laser little uh a device can break down but i also like to think of aging as scratches on the dvd so that the reader cannot read the information correctly and that's what i think is happening similarly in the body where we still have most of our genes that are intact in our body in our cells but the body doesn't read them correctly and that is a breakdown in the epi genetic information [Music]
