so [Music] what does my dinner look like i try to focus on plant foods more like a rabbit's meal than lions i try to eat vegetables that have been themselves put under adversity uh my theory is that when we put ourselves in a state of perceived adversity and plants do we get benefits and the plants that we eat if they are picked when they're stressed out so less less water a lot of sunlight organic local uh even if there are there are caterpillar holes in the leaves that's great that means that those plants are making molecules that can benefit us we call this xenohormiso so if the food is local organic it doesn't have to be pretty uh but i also i look for colored foods because the color in those leaves comes with those good molecules so one molecule that i'm known for is resveratrol in from grapes and you find it in red wine but the amounts that i take every morning with my supplements um as one of my supplements you'd need 200 300 glasses of red wine a day which i don't recommend please don't do that um well let me tell you about supplements so in the morning um i have a few what are called polyphenols resveratrol is one and a teaspoon of that powder it should be white if it's brown or anything but white or gray throw it away it's contaminated or gone bad uh sometimes i put quercetin or cressetin some people call it curcumin um and i take some physique and and all of these molecules we discovered back in 2003 to 2005 extend the lifespan of simple animals like a nematode worm and now people are finding that these molecules are very beneficial in humans as well in clinical trials so it's been proven out from uh over the last 20 or so years and so i do that but here's the important thing serena and everyone listening these plant molecules once they're extracted out of the plant they're not very soluble they're equivalent to trying to eat brick dust they'll go mostly straight through you and so the trick is to mix mix them with something oily uh or a lot of protein so yogurt is perfect i have um no sugar added yogurt greek yogurt and i mix it in and they dissolve and i know from studies that i've done on resveratrol that the absorption goes up five to ten fold with some food so do that i actually mix the powder in i don't just swallow it just to make sure it dissolves olive oil is a really good one actually don't eat too much a lot of calories in that but a few teaspoons of olive oil you might want to throw some balsamic vinegar or bay leaf in there have um a what you call a vinegarette for breakfast that's great and the oil will dissolve all those plant molecules and get them into your system and these have been molecules have been shown in animals for sure increasingly in human studies to protect against cancer and heart disease and even alzheimer's disease [Music] [Music] you
