[Music] we first showed that aging is likely to be the loss of epigenetic information in yeast going back 20 years ago but we we really had no sense that this was true in terms of cause and effect in mammals and so we took a mouse we engineered a mouse strain where we could disrupt the epigenome and if we were right well let's start with if we were wrong lots of bad things could have happened the mouse could have died the mice could have gotten uh contracted cancer and it's possible nothing happened if you disrupt the epigenome no big deal and i i think there's you know most people would have said there's a one in a thousand chance that you'll get what you're looking for which is aging but that's what we got we got aging in these mice which was pretty good result and when when you surprise yourself how good it looks is usually you're on the right track but what that what that said was we had to think differently about our our wheel of fortune these hallmarks of aging now i'm not coming out and saying the hallmarks are wrong not by any means but what i'm i'm saying is that just having a laundry list of problems doesn't explain why things occur in the first place so it's it's not a full unified theory it's really what every field is hoping for is not just a list but a real cause of you you could distill down aging into an equation uh if if this information theory is right but what's exciting is that this mouse where we disrupted the genome it didn't just get to look old and it didn't just get diseases of aging these hallmarks of aging also occurred so loss of mitochondria mitochondrial function loss of stem cells inflammation senescent cells all of these hallmarks [Music] occurred so that tells you likely that the epigenome is what i would say is upstream is is that the dam upstream and these others are tributaries which which is pretty exciting but what that also meant was that this the field that was really just focusing on longevity genes to slow one or more of these hallmarks that's what we've been doing for the last 20 years my lab certainly is involved in that through activating this activation of sort of what it also said was that if epigenetic change and noise is the upstream cause then if we address that and reverse it all these other symptoms of aging hallmarks and diseases should either be prevented or if we're really lucky can be reversed and so we we didn't know if there was an observer which you can also refer to we refer to as the backup hard drive of the youthful information in the cell we didn't know there was such such a thing um but in 2014 i became very interested in claude shannon's work and i read all of it some of the most beautiful papers i've ever read and it just i was trying to find the observer and so we were we were giving cells a whole bunch of factors that we thought might reverse their age by tapping into the observer we didn't know where the observer was if it existed we had a breakthrough about two years ago where we put in a set of three genes and it looked like we we managed to find the the zip code of the observer and the observer woke up and reset the age of the cells and when we did it in the mouse it reset the age of the mouse and old mice that lost their vision got their complete vision back again i've gone from a lab with uh just one person in my lab working on reprogramming to now probably most of the people in my lab work on it working on it so we're working really hard um one thing that that's interesting is so we can measure dna methylation age of the animal and and the cells the neurons in the eye and we can see that then that these the monarchic factors the way we deliver them and the combination doesn't cause cancer doesn't have any untoward effects in the animals even if we look very carefully histologically uh which is great news that's that's hot off the press but the reason that i'm excited about the dna methylation clock is because i think that it's a very deep layer of aging we can change superficial things uh for example we can go for a run today and change some transcription factors and change gene expression but that's not permanent that's just going to change temporarily your cells and they'll take up more glucose etc there's a deeper level where we've been working on some epigenetic factors such as sirtuins and trying to activate them but even then if you stop giving these molecules that activate the system the animal will revert back to being you know healthier and maybe longer term uh longer lived but it's not that you've really reset the clock the deep layer is the actual information that tells you your age and that's how cells really understand what type of cell they are and how old they are okay and we think that this is partly driven by dna methylation but we thought up until our paper that the methylation age these chemical marks on the dna were an indicator of biological age they were just basically the crust on the genome the plaque on your teeth so to speak you know plaque doesn't do much right it's just accumulating same we thought about the methyls but what we decided to do was to knock down or knock out we've done it both ways uh a set of genes called tets tet and there are three of them and if we we got rid of at least number one or number two we haven't studied three yet uh we didn't get the vision restoration and we didn't get the clock reversal so what does that say these enzymes are the enzymes that remove the methyl off the dna the the pick that removes the plaque off your teeth if you don't have plaque remover you don't get shiny teeth anymore and you don't get to look younger your dentist can't do a good job so that's what we've what the results are telling us is that part of the reset of the clock it's not just an indicator of age as if you move a clock hand nothing really changes but what it says is that perhaps you move the clock back and it actually changes time but to move that clock back you need to remove the dna methylation now of course that that's not sufficient we don't think we're testing whether it is sufficient but we do know it's necessary for the age to go back does this prove the existence of an observer and one of the experiments that convinced me was the following so we can look at all the the patterns of gene expression which genes are on and off in in these neurons and can look at every every gene in the cells and what we found was that genes that go down a little bit with aging in terms of getting switched off when we reprogram those cells they go back up to normal but just the right amount to where they were when they were young if a gene goes all the way way down when the animal's old it goes way up when we reprogram them remember we're not telling them which genes to turn on and off and at what level the cell somehow knows that for the whole program and so it's not mimicking an age reset it's actually fully resetting the program at the at the gene expression level at one level and the very deep level which is the dna methylation level now there are a lot of things we don't know we don't know how many times can you reset is it once which we've done or is there a hundred times and we don't know what tells the tet enzymes which methyls to remove and which ones to keep now unlike our teeth and plaque we where our teeth we can get rid of all the plaque and no one's there's no problem if we remove all the plaque off our dna all the methyls our cells will lose their identity completely and we would become the biggest pool of stem cells basically be a tumor that's not what's happening we don't have mice that have tumors in their eyes we have mice that can see again so it's as though you know now another analogy would have be a pianist playing 20 000 different genes and that pianist makes some mistakes but now we bring in a new pianist and they can play just the right notes and we're not we're not stripping all the notes off we're not ripping the piano off or the keys off the piano so the observer in my mind has to exist but exactly how the observer knows which of those changes to make to go back to restore the gene expression we don't know that at all i think there's probably a nobel prize up for grabs if someone wants to figure that out now we're giving it our best shot but in terms of philosophically where would this lie where would the observer be so it could be and i'll tell you some of my my best ideas it could be a new type of dna modification so it's on the genome uh it could be a protein that's binding to the genome when we're young that stays there for 80 years or it could be some quantum state that i hope not because that's going to take us a little longer to figure out but it's quite possible [Applause] [Music] [Applause] you
