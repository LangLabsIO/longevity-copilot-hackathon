[Music] so [Music] because one of the theories of how resveratrol works is hormesis so what the heck is hormesis and why is it so important right well hormesis is essentially what doesn't kill you makes you stronger you could possibly say what what doesn't kill you makes you live longer as well because what we discovered first in yeast cells that you know you can make beer and bread out of and eventually in animals and now in humans we found that these enzymes that i mentioned earlier called the sirtuins these are protectors in the body and they do a lot of good things they protect cell identity they repair dna they boost energy in the mitochondria which you mentioned earlier so we discovered that but then what we realized in the 2000s was that these genes and the enzymes that are produced from them are turned on by uh hormesis and what that means is any anything that puts the body in a state of perceived adversity right you don't want to actually damage the body to be able to live longer and be healthy you want to give the impression that times are going to be tough so being hungry during the day exercising these are all things that tell the sertuan genes to come on and to protect the body there are some other things that i do such as go to the sauna and jump in cold water buds to try and stimulate and get my body out of its complacency when we sit around all day i'm at a standing desk by the way of for that reason uh if we sit around all day and we don't exercise and we eat constantly our defenses don't get turned on we don't have hormesis and resveratrol which we talked about i've called a xeno-hermetic molecule which means hormesis that you get from other species such as plants so when plants are stressed they make resveratrol and other molecules like it and i have this theory and some evidence that when we eat those stress plants our body thinks that our food supply is running out and it will also have the benefits of dieting and exercise as well i love that so uh the more stressed plants i eat the less exercise i have to do is that what i'm hearing here today right let your food be stressed so you don't have to be well yeah you know an interesting aside um uh this is not to talk about i happen to have an olive oil that has 30 times more polyphenols of any olive oil and the person who developed it is in the moroccan desert and he knew that great wines come from vines that are stressed they're planted in rocks they're underwatered horrible conditions and he says you know i bet you could do that with olives so he found a rocky part of the moroccan desert underwatered them and planted the vines right next to each of the trees right next to each other so they had to compete and when he finally made the olive oil the french government found it had 30 times more polyphenols than any olive oil they had ever tested and so you're right a a stressed plant gives more polyphenols and resveratrol is certainly one of those polyphenols so i think you're absolutely right on this so yeah so we're all going to go out and eat stressed plants or stress plant by-products and that includes really good red wine is that true or is that french paradox a total myth uh i don't think it's a total myth but the amounts of resveratrol that we find we have to give people uh would be the equivalent of hundreds of glasses of red wine every day uh work work work work work yeah the news just just keeps getting better and better right but please don't don't over drink the alcohol is of course not not helpful and there's a lot of calories that said i'm happy to entertain the possibility and there's some there's some evidence from looking at populations that drinking a glass or two of red wine over 40 years can be beneficial and there's not just resveratrol in red wine there's quercetin and other things as you know steve um and so that cocktail with a bit of alcohol may be uh responsible for some of those health benefits that we call the french paradox where the french can eat a lot of cheese and fat and they don't have high rates of heart disease no yeah i think that's very true and like you say and i say in all my books look if you don't drink don't start it's rule number one i think uh what's one thing that uh my listeners can do to stimulate or mises for themselves you've mentioned several of them come on give us an easy one all right well so so having read tens of thousands of papers and read your books uh and studied this for my whole life if there's one thing that i could say that everybody needs to do it's eat less often yeah so that's not malnutrition not starvation uh please nobody uh become underweight but what this means is the three big meals a day with snacks in between in my view is ludicrous and has led us into a world of obesity so i've recently uh well actually most of my life i've skipped breakfast but more recently tried to even skip lunch and then have a normal dinner and it's been great for me and we know in mice if you here's something that i'll leave everyone with before we take the break uh i mentioned rafa to cabo down at nih my good colleague down in bethesda he did a study that i think is a landmark he mixed different types of different amounts of protein fat carbohydrate and gave 10 000 mice different versions of a diet and they all lived the same lifespan the group that lived the longest was the group that gave that had access to the food only two hours a day which argues that it's not just what you eat but when you eat that's important yeah i think that's so important and and whether we call it intermittent fasted or i like time restricted feeding which is kind of what you and i do you're you know you're an expert in this field would you please tell people why breakfast is not the most important meal of the day uh well so i found at least for myself and i assume i'm an average person uh when i measure my blood sugar so steve i've started measuring my my blood sugar with a patch you can buy it's prescription only but still it's i managed to convince one of one of my friends to let me try it what i found is that i and i've heard many others their blood sugar goes up in the morning and people like me are not hungry at all when we wake up and so it's it's really force-feeding um for many of us and i can do quite well without breakfast and i don't need it i'm actually i do much better physically and psychologically mentally without breakfast uh so i think for many people having a breakfast is not just um a waste of money it's actually it's dangerous because it's a it adds up the calories add up fast yeah that's a really good point uh you know both our cortisol and our adrenaline levels rise in the morning and that of course both kick up blood sugar and i take care of a large number of diabetics many of whom have been on insulin and one of the things they don't quite get is they always wake up with an elevated blood sugar and they think it's because of what they eat the night before and most of them unfortunately then say oh my gosh you know i've got to eat some food and that will bring my blood sugar down well in fact when they measure it again at 11 their blood sugar is down and they make this connection that the food brought it down well it didn't their cortisol and adrenaline fell normally yeah and as you know for the last now this will be my 18th year from january through june i not only don't eat breakfast but i don't eat lunch so i i'm a mouse at the nih uh i eat all my calories in a two-hour window and so far so good you know as i say i'll let you know when i'm 150 if the experiment worked [Music] you
