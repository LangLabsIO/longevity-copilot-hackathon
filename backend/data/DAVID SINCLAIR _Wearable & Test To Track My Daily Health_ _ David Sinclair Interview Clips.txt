foreign [Music] on the measurement piece that peter drucker line like what can't be measured can't be managed i'm big into measurement and so i'm wondering if there are any specific devices or wearable technology that you recommend i wear an aura ring for measuring my sleep i wear an apple watch to check physical activity heart rate things like that but i'd love to hear what some of your recommendations are those two things are a good start i do the same i do blood tests which i think eventually will be a chip under the skin but for now it's you need a some blood drawn i've been doing that for 11 years actually more uh and i've been able to see things that have gone out of whack or are trending upwards when i didn't want them to and immediately corrected them this is not what your doctor will do for you uh they're they're not not in the business of optimizing you they're in the business of treating a disease and if you don't have type 2 diabetes they're not going to give you a type 2 diabetes drug that would undoubtedly prevent type 2 diabetes um so i take a different approach the blood tests you your listeners might be saying well how do i do that well there are companies that will do this um one and in full disclosure i am an advisor and a very small co-owner of this company so you know take take my advice as as you see fit um it's called inside tracker uh it's in the us but you also if let's say you're anywhere else in the world you can upload your own data uh you i i have a health service i advise people on things and one of my clients is in turkey and they don't have inside tracker but the doctor does these 34 blood tests and we enter the data in and we look at it and see what the the ai tells us and what's different about that is that a doctor cannot store a billion data points in their head this company can with hundreds of thousands of of individuals and scientific papers and this thing you know it it has you know help from scientists and doctors but we scientists and doctors need help these days from machines so that's one thing that's that's true monitoring i've done a blood glucose monitor i don't do it anymore because i've already learned enough about my body that i don't need to to watch it and become obsessed with that i've learned the type of food such as white rice and grapes that send my glucose up tremendously and i also learned from that i'm one of the people where my blood sugar goes up early in the morning which explains why i have no need for breakfast anyway yeah there's uh there's a very clear i guess example of this um the difference between what a doctor right might recommend and what's actually the best for us that that i read i think in one of dave asprey's books where he said look at your hormones if you go to a traditional primary care doctor when you're 50 they're looking at the average for a 50 year old male not the average for a 20 year old male which maybe is your ideal self and so by supplementing with hormones and getting your body back to that age you're now feeling better you have more energy but a doctor would never ever ever make that recommendation a traditional doctor would never make that recommendation and so i'm sure there are a lot of areas of our health uh where changes like that are probably necessary yeah absolutely my doctor and my dentist they're scared when i'm coming in because i will argue about stuff um such as is it worth fixing teeth yes i i expect to be around a lot longer than you think uh is it worth giving me medicine to correct my cholesterol levels at age 29. my doctor literally said well you're not old enough to worry about that yet and and i totally freaked out i said why do we want to wait till i have heart disease give it to me now unfortunately he did um but you know when i was 29 that wasn't something that doctors tended to do for young people so that i'm not every doctor you know there are a lot of doctors that are changing their ways i think more of them need to think about the future uh and to try to help younger people stay fitter for longer not just wait until there's something to treat [Music] you
