[Music] so [Music] two months ago maybe three months ago i decided to give myself an experiment and i wasn't happy with the results i was getting with my health i was training hard i was eating well i was intermittent fasting for 16 hours a day i was sleeping well i was taking supplements like i was trying a lot of stuff and i wanted to try to like lose some extra weight but also just kind of feel like there's some little inflammation here from past injuries and sports i was like i just want to get rid of it and i said i've never tried a you know multiple day fast and i remember you mentioning about just hey eating less will help you live longer and help you get less disease which will help you live longer and i said okay i'm gonna try a i did a four days no food essentially four days no food water i had a little bit of juice on some days and i had black coffee and i just drink a lot of water it wasn't until a week after the four day fast when i started to feel the effects sure i like lost some weight because i wasn't eating for four days and i felt like healthier in general i felt super focused and clear but it wasn't until like a week two weeks later when i was like huh i just feel better i feel lighter i felt like more flexible less inflammation what is the power of doing a one day fast a two three day pass how often should we be doing these types of fasting and i want to make sure that i don't tell people go not eat for three or four days without talking to a doctor or nutritionist or something but what is the the benefit of not eating for a day or two days what does that do for our body long term well we're still learning right um we've only just finished doing we as a field of scientists have only just finished doing a lot of animal experiments but we're now in a period where we're actually finally doing these in humans so what do we know uh we know that if you fast for one day you're going to turn on these these three main mechanisms that protect the cell their names by the way that there's one called mtor which senses amino acids that we eat uh there's one called ampk which it controls and registers how much energy the cell has so if you eat sugar you'll switch it off if you're not eating sugar it'll switch on and then the ones that we work on they're called sirtuins and there are seven of these sort of proteins that protect the cell in very different ways but all seemingly good the question is how much should you be doing well we know from fasting for one day that you you activate these defenses and three defenses we want to we want to activate these three things as much as possible or once in a while good question i i think it's better to do it once in a while you don't want to always have them on and the reason i can say that is based on animal studies the best effects we've had and my colleagues have had is when you do things and let the body rest afterwards for example we did a study with resveratrol this molecule from red wine that activates one of these sirtuins that i was telling you about we gave it every day to mice or we gave them this calorie restricted fasting diet but it was when we actually gave them resveratrol every second day that we got the longest lived mice in combination with caloric restriction so that's just an example of many that we're finding that it's helpful to to pulse the body and let it let it rest and it it does make sense that you want to have a hunker down period where your body is fixing itself and removing bad stuff but then also a repair phase so when you go back to eating regularly or you're not running marathons every other day which some people tend to do then your body can recover and grow and heal so yeah long answer to your question but i think pulsing it is the right way to go is there a calculated approach to say okay if you're i'm 225 pounds male 37 years old how many calories should i be eating a day like is there a you know a perfect system to this of like okay if you eat 1 000 calories a day for three days in a row then you have 2 000 for a day then you fast today have you figured out this process yet with rats no no it's not it's number one like that yet that can be interesting yeah the problem that we face in the field is we were talking earlier you and i uh before we went on air about funding for science we don't have tens of millions of dollars to run these clinical trials we're always scrounging for money and always worried about what's going to happen when it runs out um so we can do some experiments but consider some of these longevity experiments in even in rats and mice they take about three years um and if you do it in monkeys then your whole career is used up by one experiment and so what what we're trying to now figure out is what's the right combination of what you eat when you eat and what supplements to take and that combination is hundreds of thousands and you can't run hundreds of thousands of these experiments wow so it's it's hard to find the optimum but in general what i would say is that if you fast for one day you get some benefits if you fast for three days something interesting happens you turn on another level of of cell cleansing and uh i'll tell you a bit about that so there's this process called autophagy or some people call it autophagy it is what it sounds like auto which itself and phagy is eating so you're self-eating and what that means is that proteins that are gonna be sold you're eating yourself you're killing it well eating the getting rid of the bad stuff recycling the bad proteins as we get older and also if we have damaged proteins say if we eat a lot of burnt food we will accumulate proteins that have uh oxidation is one for example and these proteins also are very hard to get rid of they tend to clump sticky they're sticky um and and alzheimer's is disease is a good example of that of uh proteins that stick together and just accumulate and you can't get rid of them easily but autophagy is this process where the cells can chew these up and recycle the amino acids in those proteins but we our bodies especially as we get older do a pretty crappy job at doing that and it leads to things like macular degeneration your degeneration and others now what what one day fasting does is it turns on autophagy and we'll clear out some of the proteins but from my reading if you do three days of fasting something else kicks in it's a different type of autophagy uh it's called chaperone mediated autophagy or cma and it was discovered by a good friend of mine in new york anna maria cuervo and she has shown that this cma process is really important for extending the health and the lifespan of mice and i'm helping her a little bit with a one of her companies to bring this to humans and hopefully treat diseases for example like macular degeneration but anyway uh so three days really starts to kick in the benefits is there a time when fasting too long hurts the body well sure you need nutrition right your body needs to need amino acids to repair itself i can't stress enough that we don't want anybody to lose so much weight that it's bad for them yeah there are a lot especially young people who you can overdo it yeah you always want to have some add a positive fat on your body you need for for lean times and your body needs it for you know energy when you're sleeping for example but so i i think that going for a week is okay i haven't done it myself it's too difficult but what's the longest you've gone personally i'm not that good at it that's about it i tell you what four days was tough but it was also like once i set my mind to it i was just like i'm gonna commit to this i also wasn't that hungry i was just like okay i can go a little farther it was just weird because i'm so used to eating every i don't know four or five hours i was just like is everything okay like but i felt the effects it felt like it was getting better like my body was healing i felt like the pain was starting to go away and i just felt clear and focused that's a common um thing that people report is you'd think that you'd be distracted by hunger but what actually happens once you do it for a longer time or you've done every other day eating for a while or even in my case where i like to skip breakfast and have a late lunch or maybe even go straight to dinner your body gets used to it you don't feel those hunger pains if you drink a cup of tea or even a glass of water it it not numbs any desire that's when you know you're doing it right but also what people report and i i can tell you from my experience it also focuses the mind and you're not distracted at all in fact it's it's it's like a high that you get and i can get a lot of work done when i i'm in that phase [Music] you
