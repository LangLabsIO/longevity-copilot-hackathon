[Music] tp is the currency or the energy brain is the most energy demanding organ and with all types of dementia with all types of neurodegeneration and in healthy aging starting from the age of 45 their levels of atp decline in 2020 there are of course multiple very um complex mechanisms of the atp generation by the way my background is also in mitochondrial biology and bioenergetics and mitochondria are the small cellular plants in the cells and they produce the atp actually the energy mostly what i want to say that the energy gap originates and it's a very complex underlying mechanism there is a number of mechanisms and the very good article or review was published in nature science by steve kunin our colleague who combined every target which can exist in the brain which leads to the energy decline it is called brain energy gap we are proposing mitocholine our composition to address the brain energy gap the vicious circle of losing atp production and neurodegeneration being associated with the energy gap we are offering combination of salt of colin succinate which is a novel combination patented and nicotinamide together and we are presenting the first multi-targeted composition because mythical line addresses several targets in the whole process of the brain energy gap we know that we need all and utilize glucose for the atp production there is a complex biochemical reactions trichobonic acid cycle and we are affecting and trying to patch this all with introducing meat haline as a as an ingredient as a nutritional fortification in the daily diet why because it all these or all components are metabolites which means that they are present in the human body therefore the toxicity level safety levels all established these components were studied before uh quite for a long time um but they've never been studied in this combination what uh decline succinate sold has been discovered and synthesized 20 years ago by the russian chemist and when i came across this patent i knew that it will work on mitochondria because it consists of succinate which is the mitochondrial substrate for complex 2 of the electron transport chain and whole line is also an essential bioactive ingredient and present in every cognitive enhancing nutraceutical on the market what igor's work my co-founder was devoted for the last 15 years of studying this novel salt of decaline succinate in the insulin pathway regulation he was able to show that it is an insulin receptor sensitizer insulin receptor a which is typical for neuronal tissue and in the brain there are two types of insulin receptors a and b and he was also and we all know that insulin resistance is the major cause now coming for the forefront to address the origin of neurodegenerative disease and the lack of the atp production in the brain we also were able to show in our experimental work that uh medical line when applies increases the levels of nadh there is no need to say what nadh is it's the enzymatic shuttle which is the most cited in the anti-aging research and in um yes so we were able to show that in neuronal cultures the actual work was done in neuronal cultures and in astrocytes and we showed that the combined effect of novel decaline salt of succinic acid and nicotinamide together work in synergy enhancing the atp level production because all the components are metabolites we were able to show also the effect in humans asking a healthy volunteer to consume a metahaline for a certain amount of days and we were able to show with the magnetic resonance spectroscopy non-invasive method that the pull of phospho-creatinine the precursor for atp is actually increased very physiologically intrinsically on the day 7 and 16. so all this including the small informal clinical trial which were conducted starting on the students and um in the people aged 60 uh were able to show the effect of chronic mythical line intake as a supplement or as a nutritional fortification or just simply being in the diet and it elevated the mental focus and fatigue [Music] you
