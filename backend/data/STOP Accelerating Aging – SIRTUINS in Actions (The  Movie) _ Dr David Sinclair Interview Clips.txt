[Music] all right i have a movie to show you so one of the things that happens on the chromosome that disrupts the cell's identity and the ability to read the genes is a broken chromosome okay wherever you see that flash the chromosome is being broken and when you break a chromosome a cell gets really nervous because it's actually the worst thing you can do to a cell because if a cell doesn't repair a chromosome it'll it'll die or it'll become a tumor you've got to fix it no question you cannot live with broken chromosomes so what i showed you in that video those balls are proteins in the cell that we've discovered when i was over at mit and now and more recently in my lab these proteins are what we call longevity enzymes they're encoded by longevity genes and when we turn them on the animals very healthy they're great we have mice that live longer and we think in our bodies they keep us young but they unfortunately they have two functions the first function is really important it's to maintain the structure of of the the epigenome to keep us young so that's great when when we're young these proteins are in the right place they're sitting on the right genes and so the genes that should be on or on and the genes that should be offer off but as i showed you in this video their other role is that they get distracted by broken dna okay if you go out in the sun and you get sunburned you broke a lot of dna unfortunately so these proteins are moving from where they should be in a panic to try and repair the dna uh there's a reason for that i think that it's that they're moving because they're they're telling the cell there's an emergency you've got to fight you've got to survive but if you keep doing that as i showed so this is an acceleration of of what i think happens during aging let's have a look again these proteins are perfect perfectly aligned then they get distracted by the break they go back to where they came from they go to the break they go back to where they came from they go to the break whoops didn't go back whoops didn't go back so this is aging i believe and we can test this we can create this in the lab in a in an animal and ask what happens and we've done that it's taken us 10 years um i'll tell you a little bit about these guys so these genes are called sirtuins that we've worked on and uh it's it's pretty interesting um when you think about why they're called sirtuins and uh you probably don't know the first three letters of sirtuin is s-i-r and that stands for silent which means turn the genes off silence them information regulator okay so it in the name of these genes has been the answer all along i believe information regulation is the key to longevity but breaking dna is one of the things that accelerates aging because it distracts them and eventually like opening and re-gifting a present a thousand times it's going to be pretty ugly by that point but the question that i've been asking myself in the lab for the last few years is is there a treatment you can give to a cell or an old animal or eventually an old person that can go from there back to frame one and get them to go back to where they came from so that the cell reads the right genes to be a neuron a young healthy neuron or a young skin cell [Music] you
