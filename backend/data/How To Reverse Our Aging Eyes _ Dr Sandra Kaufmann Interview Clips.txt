[Music] foreign as you age several Things Fall Apart number one most importantly that everyone sees is presbyopia which is the inability to focus up close right and that has to do with glycation or stiffness of the lens right the lens is really interesting because you try to block radiation out of every other part of your body we cover ourselves in sunscreen we you know but the lens is attracting it so there's a heck of a lot of free radical damage in the lens and because there's not a whole lot of blood flow there's not a whole lot of endogenous free radical scavengers on top of that it gets horribly glycated so your your lens is just a sit and duck so what's amazing about this is everyone gets presbyopia roughly the same time right pretty much everyone in their mid-40s pulls out their reading glasses in a restaurant I know you've probably been out to dinner everyone passes their glasses around it's kind of kind of ridiculously pathetic but they do right but what's interesting is so if presbyopia is your only problem carnosine eye drops are amazing so it's it's the same thing that you would orally take but it comes in an eye drop um I've been using them now for a decade and my up close vision is perfect wow it might not be true but it should be true uh there's a fabulous Russian study they gave these eye drops to I don't know half a million people and they're they're they're up their Vision got significantly better so it's truly amazing it also reduces the risk of cataract but they actually give these eye drops to dogs to cure cataracts like Lord forbid we ever said to a human we could cure your cataract because then the Ophthalmology people would go out of business because they wouldn't you know be able to charge five thousand dollars to take out your Cataract and put an implant that being said this will reduce the risk of cataracts I mean will it get rid of it completely probably not but it will prevent a lot of this stuff so that's one thing that goes wrong with your eyeball over time the other interesting that changes is the rods and cones in the back of your retina deteriorate right when people are driving at night they can't see as well and that's because concert for color rods are for black and white and they just deteriorate over the course of time and eye drops don't usually get to the back of your retina so that's something that comes through your your systemic vasculature for the most part um and so different agents that that are required by the rods and the cones do better there astaxanthin is a fantastic example astaxanthin was fantastic it helps your vision as do the other xanthins the zeaxanthin and there's a few xanthins but if you ever look at Eye Health it's all the xanthins and it's just because those are the molecules that are required in the rosin the cones to keep your retina healthy um the other one that's really good is the skq1 it's called vizomittin and it's amazing for eyes and it goes specifically to the mitochondria it's a strong free radical scavenger and it just really helps vision foreign [Music]
