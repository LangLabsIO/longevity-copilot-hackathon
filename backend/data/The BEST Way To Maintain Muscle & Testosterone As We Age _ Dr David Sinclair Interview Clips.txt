[Music] uh so resistance training uh so I uh used to do a lot um so I would love to do more so going back to what I used to do I used to work out at least one time a week which was intense it was for two hours at the gym or at my house I like to do it every other day mixing it up upper body lower body uh what we tell clients is to to make sure not to forget your back and hips um and and upper thighs because the longevity which is what we're here to talk about that's crucial as you get older you're losing a lot of mass in fact uh particularly males after uh the age of 40 they're losing it one or two% a year but women too they also lose testosterone and one of the the most dangerous things to do is to lose muscle mass in your hips because I think we all know of people or even our family members who have fallen over when they're older and broken a hip or broken a femur and that's a really fast way to end in your life because if you're frail and old you often don't recover from that anyway the point really is move you've got to move if you want to live a long time you have to move walking is great for maintaining those hips and lower back you'll feel better you'll have a b bigger spring in your step when I did a lot of Weights um I not just look better but actually felt so much better um I felt like I was walking on air um and that wasn't just because I bought new shoes it was because the muscles in my legs were good and for men and women to maintain hormone levels particularly testosterone want to maintain that muscle mass your leg muscles your back muscles these big muscles they will signal to your genitals to produce an adrenal system to produce these hormones and that's one of the best possibly the best way to maintain your hormone levels as you get [Music] older
