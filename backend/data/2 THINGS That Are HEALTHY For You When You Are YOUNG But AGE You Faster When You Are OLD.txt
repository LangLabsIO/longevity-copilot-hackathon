[Music] foreign [Music] they serve as tumor suppressors they get activated and primalignment cells trigger interferon responses out there so that's useful but during aging they start to play a negative role because they can become activated indiscriminately not only premalignant cells but in all cells they become activated they also Drive interferon response but now you know that it serves no purpose it just drives sterile inflammation and promotes age-related disease and actually this concept of Double H word it's also been proposed earlier by Judy Campisi in relation to sell us in essence where it serves as a tumor suppressor um earlier in life but then with aging it becomes a driver of inflammation and even driver of malignancy so that probably something typical for two of tumor suppressor mechanisms that they benefit us early but later in life they become also contributors to the aging process we know we meaning the field now I think would agree that senescence can best be understood as a stress response it's the way cells have have evolved a program to respond to certain types of stressors The Way We Now think of the stress response is that it's a double-edged sword there's tons of data that go back two decades or more showing that the arrest of cell proliferation is extremely important for preventing cancer so that's stressed cell is in danger of becoming a cancerous cell and the stress response intrinsic to the cell says no way you will never divide again and therefore you cannot form a tumor so there are Mouse models now and even some people with mutations in the genes that regulate that growth arrest and those people die in early death due to cancer and the mice die in early days early death so we know the growth arrest suppresses tumorogenesis the secreting the secreted factors we also now know can be beneficial for tissue repair and wound healing so we've shown for example in the skin senescent cells appear at the wound and they produce growth factors that help the wound heal that's the good news yes the bad news is as these cells gradually accumulate with age and don't disappear they begin to drive this process of chronic inflammation and that chronic inflammation caused by senescent cells is also a double-edged sword on the one hand it attracts the immune cells that will eventually begin to cause tissue destruction and degeneration on the other hand the cytokines that attract the immune cells can also have an effect on neighboring cells and cause them to not function properly so that's the bad side the good news is there are very few senescent cells in young people and Below age 50 or 60 you don't see very many of those cells in tissues but with after about the midpoint of our lifespan they become detectable and now you can imagine that those cells as they build up they start to drive the pathologies that we associate with aging foreign [Music]
