[Music] uh you know one of the most powerful uh things that goes on in our physiology that amps up inflammation is high uric acid uric acid is powerfully inflammatory powerfully increases the production of free radicals incredibly important in increasing insulin resistance compromises something called nitric oxide so reduces our blood vessels ability to expand reduces blood supply to our organs reduces how insulin works by virtue of inhibiting nitric oxide so you know it's a it's a bad player in the context of our current lifestyle that's for sure uric acid turns out to be a powerful lever we can pull to help improve our metabolism along with many other things that people know about getting enough sleep uh doing the exercise all the things uric acid is now on the table it's in our it's a new tool in the toolbox what raises uric acid is fructose alcohol and purines mostly in our diets it's the fructose that's found in fruit juice and in sodas fruit reasonable amounts is totally fine it is offset in terms of raising your acid by the vitamin c the bioflavonoids and the fiber that all work to lower uric acid purine-rich foods include things like organ meats small fish sardines anchovies herring can you eat them yes you can eat them but measure your own uric acid level and see if it's affecting you like eating foods and watching your blood sugar on your continuous glucose monitor you can buy a uric acid monitor online on amazon or online other places and have it at your home in a couple of days they're not hugely expensive and it's a finger stick just like measuring your blood glucose a couple of key supplements quercetin 500 milligrams a day a day a luteolin another bioflavonoid 100 milligrams per day dha mostly from fish oil but there are vegetarian sources a thousand milligrams per day chlorella vulgaris or just typical chlorella that's the latin name thousand milligrams per day and finally good old vitamin c helps us excrete uric acid 500 milligrams per day now what a person might need to do to get her your acid level below 5.5 or his uric acid level below 5.5 same for men and women will be determined by measuring the uric acid level but i know keep in mind that high uric acid paves the way for metabolic mayhem in terms of blood pressure body weight dyslipidemia elevated triglycerides uh and even insulin resistance we've got to reign in our metabolism powerful tool for longevity and not just living a long life but a healthy life and you know the body work is so important as well as gosh aaron you've made so clear to us over so many years their uric acid an incredible study published in the journal the american medical association treated uh pretty hypertensive adolescents who had elevated uric acid with a a drug a gout drug to lower their uric acid and low and beheld their blood pressures improved so it's a very very big deal and we can dramatically impact uric acid with quercetin uh you know with ludiolin which uh we could talk about question uh for our next hour together in terms of all the cool things that it does that's one of my showcase supplements these days that's for sure [Music] you
