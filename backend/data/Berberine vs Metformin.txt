[Music] it's really interesting from a pharmacological point of view or an molecular basis because the molecules look extraordinarily different there you know I I could have went into this thinking that they were going to be very similar and therefore you know their activities and such can be similar um and they are they do act in a very similar fashion but molecularly they're very different so you have to wonder like how that happens throughout an evolutionary scale but they both do fantastic things right they're both amp kinase activators which makes them partial M4 Inhibitors they change their microbiota they do just a lot of things but then there are some things that some do and some don't right so metformin controls the mitochondrial transition pore which is amazing and there was no evidence that berberine did that anyway so they're they're slightly different things that they both do and my favorite study actually demonstrated in people like real people that 500 milligrams of each one separated by eight hours a day I was the most beneficial way to go you know when I wrote book one I was on this huge metformin kick and I probably took far too much every day took 850 twice a day for my body size which is probably a bit Overkill and then after sort of doing the research on Burberry and I'm like oh my God this is truly amazing and let's let's let's look at the synergistic effects rather than assuming that one thing is going to do everything and this is also sort of a theme that sort of came out of book two as well you don't need the same high doses of individual agents for things that are synergistic 501 500 or the other together on a daily basis seem to be more beneficial than high doses of Metformin with with none of the side effects so I thought that you know what that's that's now I think the way to go foreign [Music]
