[Music] um so here I mentioned parabiosis but I want to now mention um an Insight that's pretty recent which is that cell cell communication does affect epigenetic clocks and you can see several different vignettes in the literature um so what is cell cell communication well um whatever goes through your blood plasma for example could be hormones could be exosomes and um here I show you a very recent paper from Harold catcher and Rudy Goya and um ake sangavi and Gordon L and many authors where we investigated male RS and we um administered a treatment fundamentally based based on exosomes interestingly exosomes extracted from pigs so Harold catcher developed a treatment um that he then applied to these rats and what you want to do is to compare the Red Bar to the orange bar in um what you see is we start with rats that may be 2 years old two year two year-old liver and after we administer this E5 treatment it's called exosome treatment we see drastic epigenetic Rejuvenation of multiple organs blood liver heart to lesser extent the hypothalamus you know and um these results are so dramatic that I initially really struggled even believing them you know but then um as I mentioned there are several other people who have worked in that space for example here I show you a study of this parabiosis idea you connect an the circulation circulatory system of an old mice with a young Mouse and then you collect the organs two months later after you detached these mice and there you still see benefits you know so um parabiosis has the expected effect but I could show you um and here let me finish with the human study uh James Clement did a phase one clinical trial where he injected umbilic cord plasma high concentrations of that into um older adults and um Grim age was slightly rejuvenated you know so I see plenty of evidence in the literature that this young plasma idea and um affects epigenetic age you know um okay maybe I'll stop here um any questions at this point yeah go ahead can you tell us what when ni Lifan after that you know the yeah let me start with yeah I want to be give you precise answers so I'll start with this rat study and there are unpublished data that show that this also extended the lifespan as a matter of the fact I think the guardian or a newspaper wrote an article about the oldest rat that ever lived I think the rat is called SEMA or and that rat was treated with this elix E5 compound which is a stunning result and then I have a collaborator Rudy Goya and he inject injected young plasma um also into rats and also observed the longevity effect you know and um yes so that's one answer so one would think it has an effect um when we come to parabiosis the answer is a bit more comp licated um parabiosis where you stitch together two animals is actually quite stressful to the animal and both have a shorter lifespan but in that paper they also showed an a lifespan Advantage maybe um I want to talk a little bit about history there was an American scientist I think MLive um he invented caloric restriction he was the same person who invented quote unquote heterochronic parabiosis and he also used strats and also showed a lifespan benefit of um so these findings are quite old you know they go back to the 1950s you know but what we now un see in the past people just measured lifespan now we can look at the genomic biomarkers yeah [Music] n
