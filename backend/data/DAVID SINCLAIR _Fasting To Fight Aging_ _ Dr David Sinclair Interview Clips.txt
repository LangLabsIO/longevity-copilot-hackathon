[Music] so [Music] um it is interesting for me because i i do intermittent fasting now for um i don't know quite i'm 48 i'm almost almost 50 now so yeah i'm 48 and something yeah yeah i didn't think so i i you thought i was like 47. you know when someone wanted to make a compliment and say well not really you are so anyway i'm almost 30 and i'm doing intermittent fasting and um and i'm the funny thing for me is that i tried i was not interested at all about aging when i was you know in my 20s i thought yeah who cares and now that i'm you know getting to the 50s i think well what should i do you know so anyway intermittent fasting i i am i'm doing it and i i was always um able to skip breakfast always but i remember that i was forced in italy to eat breakfast because everyone say hey you have to eat breakfast to be stronger so i i was always eating breakfast i mean my wife say why don't you eat breakfast like it's a bad thing and now that intermittent fasting is out there i say guys you see that i was not so so wrong so i i see a lot of people i also interview wim hof and he said you know i just sit once a day or something like that so i see a lot a lot of this movement growing so i'm happy to see that is not only in my head or my habit but has got a scientific reason but but why does it work this is what i don't understand oh well we we know quite a lot about that um our body just relaxes when there's no threats um there's a there's a term called hormesis which means what doesn't kill you makes you stronger and longer lived and we have these genes in our bodies there are three main sets of genes i work on one set called sirtuins there are others one called ampk another one mtor and these are genes that respond to adversity or threats to survival so what's the worst we can do to make sure that they don't protect us sit down eat a lot of food don't don't lift anything heavy uh don't eat foods that are from stressed plants because plants when they are also under adversity we think they signal our body with molecules like resveratrol from red wine so a lot of what we do now is we have plants that are super healthy in greenhouses we sit down all day uh and we eat whenever we want these protective pathways are switched off and we age faster this is the problem modern life is killing us but there's ways to make the body fight back and that's why exercise being hungry and eating foods of certain types are what will activate these genetic defenses now how do they work that would take you know another few hours or in my book i explained why and how that we think they work but essentially they're like uh the pentagon in the us they they sense a threat and they send out the troops to protect the body my second question was should i fast one day intermittent fasting should i add an extra one day full fasting should i go for longer period because i read about longer saying you know the different system to do this fasting so what what what do you suggest okay so the the scientific fact is that we don't know what's optimum optimum but i would say uh even a little bit will help um but there are a few different types so it sounds like you and i do what's called the 16 8 yeah right so it's try to fast for 16 hours if you can including sleep there's another version which is don't eat for two days so that's the 5-2 method which i don't do because i find it it's it's too difficult for me but a lot of people do that try not to eat on the weekend or whatever if you can go for at least two days and even better if you can do three i think um i think that that's that's probably going to have better effects in the long run because there's a type of cleaning out of the body called autophagy which there are two levels of autophagy it's just the normal level um which is macro autophagy and then there's this other there's micro level like the pro level the level yeah it is the real deep cleaning and that gets activated after two or three days of hunger and so yeah you and i i don't know if you've gone for two days have you tried going for no no two days no i is out of my pay grade i think above my favorite but uh well i try one day it's hard intermit uh just sixteen eight easy but if i go one day you know what i start to be very cold when i don't eat like i'm cold properly cold so i don't know yeah that's a that's a symptom of this um we drink some hot tea or whatever but you know i i'm with you i find it's hard to go for longer uh there's a there's a doctor here in the u.s peter attia sounds italian to me he uh he goes sometimes for a week without eating um probably four four times a year something like that and i think that that would be great if you could do it got it so there's different levels but the bottom line with with my book is what i say is um don't give up on anything i try it a little bit and often these things you have to get used to it initially if you try to skip breakfast uh and lunch you will feel like it's too much so to start with a little bit you know every other day try to have a small breakfast if you are used to it but the other thing that's important is that everybody's different and what works perfectly for me and my father may not feel good for someone else you know my my wife needs to have breakfast every day well she's german but dinner is not as important and so you could vary how you do your fasting that's a good point if my wife doesn't eat breakfast she will kill me so i prefer that she breakfast but but i prefer to live you know but i agree it is different everyone different [Music] you
