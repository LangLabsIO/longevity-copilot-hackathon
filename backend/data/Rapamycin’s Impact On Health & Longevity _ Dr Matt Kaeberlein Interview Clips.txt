[Music] foreign is a small molecule inhibitor of mtor and it has been shown you know in yeast and worms and flies and mice to extend lifespan and in mice I would say now there are at least a dozen groups that have seen lifespan extension and probably two dozen that have seen various Health span metrics improved during aging with rapamycin in mice so it is you know it's kind of like I don't I I don't know how familiar you are with with C elegans but anybody who's a CL against aging person will get this it's kind of like the daf 2 of C elegans where it works for everybody it works robustly so for me that gives me a ton of confidence that there's something real here I think we still don't know and it would be dishonest to say otherwise we still don't know to what extent will rapamycin or other strategies for inhibiting mtor affect Aging in people or in pet dogs which is another area that I'm interested in but in mice at least it's rock solid crystal clear or rapamycin has broad effects on health during aging and increases lifespan you know at least across the three or four different genetic backgrounds where it's been tested I would say that is another missing piece of the puzzle nobody has yet really tried to look across many different genetic backgrounds in mice to see you know where does rapamycin work well where maybe doesn't it work well it's also possible that in some cases it might even be harmful right and that's something that we don't typically do in the Aging field in part because you know aging studies and mice are expensive and take a long time so it's understandable that we don't typically look at interaction with genotype but but nobody's done that really with rapamycin broadly speaking yet and I think there's reason why that that should be done because we know with caloric restriction at least that there's a big effect of genetic background on the impact that caloric restriction has on lifespan so it it might be the case that that's true also for rapamycin and just it just hasn't been done yet so but but the reason why I'm so excited about it is it works for everybody it works robustly and it seems to broadly impact Health across lots of different tissues and organs in a mouse during aging and so it seems to be impacting Health span not just one disease or not just lifespan [Music]
