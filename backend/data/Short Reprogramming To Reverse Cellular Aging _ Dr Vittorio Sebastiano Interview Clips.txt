[Music] so I I wanted to kind of set the stage so why does it matter uh what for example uh myself and others you know in the field are doing as a potential therapy for the future well the reason why it matters is is very important it's because we are projected to be in about 30 years from now 10 billion people on this planet 10 billion people maybe slightly more slightly less twenty percent of them me included will be 60 years old or older okay so two billion people on the planet okay so what does it mean well it means that you know where overall we're gonna be a very wise kind of you know population right what it also means is that uh two billion people will be at risk of developing one or more conditions which are associated with aging and aging as we have heard is the number one risk factors for for those conditions so we develop those conditions because we get older all right what can be done today what could be done tomorrow but fundamentally even if we do we're still gonna age we're still gonna deteriorate with time so the question is can we do something beyond that all right so that is what we are trying to do okay so let me step let me take a step back because again I want to to explain you very carefully what I'm going to talk about so regardless of whether we are young or we are old Okay the reason why we live is because there are very special cells in our body they're called stem cells they're very rare they do not exist in every tissue some tissues have a lot skin intestine some tissues have very few for example the brain some tissue has tissues have none the thymus and the heart for example there is no stem cells at least up to now we haven't been able to discover them right so it is because of stem cells that we live as long as we do if we didn't have stem cells you can see it right here we would lose our intestine in two days it would be gone we would lose our skin in three weeks will be gone and we would lose our blood cells in about four months so stem cells are there to regenerate right are there to replenish what gets damaged what gets lost and we lose millions of cells millions of cells every single day all right so stem cells are there they're very rare they're very quiet very shy you know they typically don't do much right they're uh they just reside in the in the tissues and they're just waiting for signal from the from the outside from the body okay now it's time for you to do something because for example we got a damage we got a wound uh you know something happens and accidents uh a broken bone whatever that is there is a signal for them to say okay it's time to regenerate the tissue that you are residing in all right so that's what stem cells do okay they are again rare somewhere in the body and their function is just to regenerate the the tissue so unfortunately to go back to one of the questions like why don't we live forever I mean we have a perfect system here why we don't live forever well unfortunately we don't live forever because of what Marco and Madeline have said already but also because in addition to the what they have said there is a phenomenon which is called epigenetic Drift it means that progressively when they divide the cells they are not identical to what they were before every time they divide they accumulate damage every time we drink too much you know we don't sleep enough we get stressed out we yell at our partner you know every time something like this happens you know they there is damage coming from the outside that basically signals to the nucleus to the central core of the cells and there is a progressive accumulation of damage that's why we age in very simple terms of course so this leads to deterioration of stem cells organs tissues and so on and so forth so what are the possible solutions for the day after tomorrow okay so one solution is that we can generate new stem cells new tissues new organs or forget about that we can rejuvenate your existing stem cells your existing organs your existing tissues okay so that's what I'm going to talk about so how do we do this okay so let me take a quick step back so we have we have learned that there are stem cells there are other cell types in our body okay now a few years back about 12 15 years ago a Japanese scientist he's called the yamanaka probably you have heard about him made a brilliant Discovery he figured out that actually you can take let's say a skin let's say you can take a skin cell uh from from your from your from from your arm okay you think you can take that cell so what does what that cell does is just it's a skin cell it doesn't do anything else all right you can take that skin cell and you can reprogram it okay so you can change its identity to an embryonic like state so you can make an adult cell and you can turn it into an embryonic like so why is this so brilliant because embryonic cells because they are embryonic-like they can differentiate then not only in the original skin cell type but also into any other cell type of the body brain cell liver cells blood cells bone cells you name it all right so this is brilliant because now virtually from any person you guys we can make embryonic-like cells from your skin cells and now we have a source potentially of organs tissues you know that can be used for you know for transplantation for example so prolonged so this process is very long it takes about three to four weeks on average to go from here to here and then depending on the cell type you're dealing with with the organ you're dealing with it may take another four weeks or months so there's still a lot of work going on here and this is one of the challenging factors so prolonged reprogramming gets you here all right um so the good thing is that they are Unlimited in numbers so once you make them they are Immortal but Immortal in a good way not in a cancer way okay so they're Immortal in a good way so that means that you can make as many as you want okay and so you can really generate a lot of cells from them right uh they are genetically matched so that means that you know if I make IPS from you they're called IPS if I make IPS from you and then I make a lever from those cells their the lever is genetically identical to you so you're not going to have immune rejection um so they can use as we said to regenerate any cell of the body and in the near future and I'm the optimistic guys if you if you didn't figure it out yet but in the near future from those cells we will be able to bioprint issues organs and some some people are actually working in generating using the same cells organs in large animals for example pigs sheep and so on for transplantation okay uh so right now it's kind of still early stages so it's kind of you know Discovery uh r d no no no we're they're doing it in Peaks and in really large animals yeah yeah yeah yeah it needs it needs a very very sophisticated uh approval from the ethical from the ethical Committee of course because yeah they're not using primates because it's it's way too expensive so they're using the pigs for example sheep goats so here in the United States yes human organs yes in animals that I mean I know the ethical the ethical question is coming okay we can keep it for later um okay so what we have discovered in my lab and this is the foundation then of turn is that when you do this reprogramming you go from an aged skin cell to a youthful embryonic cell so you have two things happening changing identity of the cells and change in cellular age right what we have discovered is that if you stop the reprogramming so if you stop the expression of these uh let's call it magic cocktail early enough the cells don't change their identity so a skin cell remains a skin cell but it's just a more youthful version of it okay so short reprogramming does not impact cell identity but it does impact cellular age um and so a long story short I'm envisioning a future and we have already shown it again at the proof of concept level for now there's still a ton of studies to do but we have shown that actually by by pulsing the expression for a short time of these reprogramming factors that work on the epigenetic drift problem that we talked about before you end up with a youthful cell and it's youthful by all means not only youthful because it's epigenetically useful but it's mitochondrally useful it can say it can interact with the environment in a more youthful fashion and so on and so forth but it's still the same cell so now the idea would be that if if this works in Vivo for example there is no way for me to take your skin cell reprogram them to IPS make a lever and then transplant it I can go directly into your liver and make it younger so that's the idea okay we are far away from that but that's the idea okay and so basically this is this is what you know kind of a nice rendering of what I talked about so we are we're really seeing and it's not working of course but we're really seeing a future where uh the basically we would be able to reprogram rejuvenate make the cells younger uh again uh I don't think that there's going to be one solution there's going to be many different solutions and we should actually use them all for for the common the common purpose which is extending enhancing Health spend that's what I think so I have to make a correction overall what you have said is is correct but there is just a small imprecision there uh actually The Germ cells so that the sperm and the Egg actually those are the cells that do not age so that's one of the reasons why I believe that at the biological level immortality is possible because the germ cells are the link between myself my kids my grandsons and so on and so forth and are a connection between myself my parents my grandparents because there is a Continuum that doesn't end so there is an immortality of life okay so you said humankind is is uh is aging no no as a species you know Homo sapiens like any other species is not aging the species doesn't age it's the individuals within the species that age okay so I don't know if I personally don't think there is a design but it doesn't matter life is Immortal we are connected through our germ cells again as I said before we are connected with the earliest forms of life that showed up billions of years ago on the Earth We're connected to them so life is Immortal okay yes but there are mechanisms and the work that we have been doing is actually inspired from those mechanisms there are mechanisms that prevent aging from being transpassed from one generation to the following there are embedded mechanism in reproduction that allow whatever mistake is made and again I'm talking you know broadly okay there are always exceptions okay but there are mechanisms in The Germ cells and in the embryos that kind of wipe out the epigenetic mistakes that have been accumulated in the meanwhile and that's why and that's why there is a perpetuation of life so we do it by uh so how do you reprogram the cells so basically you provide the cells with genes okay so these are the genes are basically uh instructions you know in the DNA that tell the cells what to do okay in very simple terms so basically we are providing the cells with those genes in the in a form of RNA it's called RNA so we are trans fat so we are really injecting inside the cells those mrnas that typically are not there and those genes are so powerful you know uh that they go into the nucleus and they start reorganizing rewiring restructuring uh the chromatin in ways that again we are still far from understanding but in ways that seem to lead to a more functional youthful uh state so so do you use mRNA technology yes okay because mrnas are relatively simple to make okay uh they they don't change the Genome of the cells so when you inject an mRNA into a cell the cell remains genetically unaltered if you inject DNA into a cells the DNA can integrate into this into the genome and can change it sometimes in unpredictable way mrnes plants mRNA is just going and what they do is make the protein that they're supposed to make and the protein does the job as simple as that so why is this important well again very easy to make uh technology we are learning how to print mrnas at very very large scale so this is going to impact the cost of the mrnas it's going to drop it down dramatically it's going to make you know medicine mrna-based medicines very affordable very Democratic okay for everybody it's going to scale up the production the production kind of capacity okay because at the end of the day it's going to be a you know like printers of rnas that are going to just work uh you know and just generate mrnas and you know in a limited fashion so this is going to really impact and I think that the future of gene therapy and you know gene therapy goes beyond what I've told you gene therapy is the ability to provide a gene that is missing whatever that is the spike protein for covid-19 or whatever that is you know mrnas are going to actually be the revolution you know for for the future so yeah it's a good example of you know when technology meets science and there is an inflection points all of a sudden thank you
