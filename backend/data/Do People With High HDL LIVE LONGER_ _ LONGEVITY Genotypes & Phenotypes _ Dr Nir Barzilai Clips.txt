[Music] what we did is actually we tried to look at the phenotype and and look at the gen at the genotype that's related to the phenotype and one of the things that came up almost immediately but on the 10 first centenarians and then again in the next 20 centenarians is that those families have very high hdl cholesterol now hdl cholesterol levels in men are average 45 and in women are average 55. and i'm talking about people who had above 100 up to 150 hdl cholesterol so it was really important markers and we started to look for a genotypes associated with hdl cholesterol and we found two genotypes that were very interesting one is a ctp genotype and one is an apoc3 genotype and i don't know if you want me to go through biology but the more important thing is that a genotype and that's why genetic research is so important now a pharmaceuticals want to have a proof of concept in humans because they before they develop any drug they want to find the humans who have mutation that makes a disease or mutation that prevents a disease and ctp targeting ctp was very important for companies pfizer started it but then merck pfizer developed a terrible drug okay it wasn't the pathway it's the drug that wasn't good but merck developed a drug that was much better and they came and wanted to see the data because if their ctp inhibitor is doing what our genetic is doing then it's a great safety signal because those centenarians had 100 years of inhibition of ctp okay and so so you can you can cross that of your worries and the same happened with the apple c3 genotype with two papers one from amish population and one from us the first was from us to say that people with this mutation had high hdl low triglycerides and and their highest high perc percentage of them in centenarians not not all centenarians had ctp but it went from like four to eight percent to uh 15 to 20 so when you have a genotype that kind of survives in centenarian you kind of assume that it's a longevity genotype so that's what happened so they developed drugs and had phase 3 trials and those drugs have been really effective so it just shows you there there's a way a direct way to go from genetics where you find the mechanism to developing drug and it's also you know when people are saying oh centenarians but i'm not a centenarian as well that's exactly the point the centenarians don't need that but we can develop drugs so you can have a drug and they said you mean not a genetic fix we don't need to have a genetic intervention no most of our genetic finding can be targeted by drugs so ctp is a cholesterol ester transfer protein okay so it basically takes the cholesterol and move it okay eventually moves it out of the body into the bile out of the body and as i said the ctp is inhibiting this process and what happens this cholesterol is stuck on hdl that's becoming bigger and bigger okay so on one hand we're doing something not so good or balancing something not so good we're stopping the cholesterol from going out on the other hand we're building this hdl that might have an importance as a molecule to protect you know coronaries endothelial things and maybe other cells but i don't know you know i i was careful to say that we're looking for biomarkers um or i said phenotype maybe i meant i meant biomarkers an example and i don't know if the hd it's the hdl or the fact that all the lipoprotein are large okay so the ldl is large also and small ldl is one that we certainly know uh induces coronary disease so maybe it's not about hdl maybe it's only about large ldl cholesterol okay so i but by looking at this study we see associations and i cannot tell you mechanism in fact the mechanism is very very confusing because i have somehow to balance two things i cannot stop totally uh ctp but having a large hdl and the other size are are okay so that's just an example you know high hdl is associated with less coronary disease but what was more important in our study it was much more strongly associated with cognitive function people with the highest hdl people with fctp mutation had the best cognitive function um so so we might be missing other actions of of this hdl and when merck did the study i suggested that they use the opportunity to do cognitive tests and they did cognitive tests but they did cognitive tests on people over the age of 50. you don't see those things you know between 50 and 70. you have to have an older population in order to see effect on cognition so i think in a way it was a missed opportunity and and maybe it could have been different so the hdl this is how i'm using the hdl if somebody comes to me and says my uh grandmother or mother you know father is a centenarian i would ask them what's your hdl and if their hdl is high i would say i think you're very likely the bad news for you you're very likely to be very old we're doing we're doing other biomarkers uh in our study so for example and my favorite is a we did by optimur technology it's a new technology 5 000 proteins in thousand of our subjects half of them were children of centenarians and half of them were controlled and the nice thing with a proteins so so we we have very good clocks for methylation to to to do our our biological age but methylation is kind of stable um and what what we want is not only a biomarker that tells you your biological age we want a biomarker that will change when you're giving a gero therapeutics okay that's what's the important for us and i think the proteins are much more likely to change for example some of our proteins are proteins that are reflecting a breakdown it's plasma proteins but they're reflecting breakdown extra extra matrix collagen the granulation of white cells or thrombocytes and i think however you target aging you have to stop this breakdown so i think those proteins are going to be maybe better biomarkers than others by the way in everything in the genetics as well as in the proteomic things that are related to the growth hormone igf uh pathway are also changing a lot in in our subject between 65 and and 95 so uh there's there's a lot to that so so the biomarkers we're we're doing omics now and we're measuring biomarkers from different points of view from ventilation from histone deacetylation from protein from metabolomics in order to find what are the sets that are going to predict not only your age but will change when you are intervening [Music] you
