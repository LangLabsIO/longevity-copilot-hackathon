[Music] so we coined this phrase about 10 years ago it's the idea that if you don't measure it you can't fix it and we drive cars with dashboards and we take it for granted that we need to know when we're speeding we need gas when we're overheating but we don't do the same for our bodies we typically go in maybe once or twice a year to see our doctors or see dentists and that's crazy our cars are monitored constantly by computers our bodies are not and i would say our bodies are way more important than our cars we don't want our bodies to get anywhere near being overheated or or needing a big service and going to the doctor once a year for an annual checkup to me seems medieval what we want to do is to measure our bodies well but at least every few months we would need to know more detail than just questions we need to know data i'm a scientist i'm driven by data and you can measure things externally you can have a watch you can have a ring uh we also can be more advanced we can measure heart rate and i have devices that actually uh differ a lot about art stick it on my chest um i've got one here that um sometimes i wear on my chest and this will measure my body's movement temperature heart rate all sorts of issues with my heart i'm going to have a heart attack you don't know um and it probably costs 20 bucks to make eventually it'll be even less uh and so this is my body a thousand times a second and it syncs up with my phone i hold this down it starts to go green and uh and these things are the way of the future so that we're not just having a measurement uh with a blood test from our doctor once every year um i do blood bio tracking um that is on our website linked to this uh it's called inside tracker and they uh do tests for me and they take a number of readings i will talk about those readings later uh you can measure their hormones uh and then ultimately you know you can even measure um your brain how your brain is doing and how well you're sleeping and all of that's important for longevity as well and then if you don't know those numbers you don't know what's negatively affecting you or positively you don't know what you're eating if it's affecting you or your supplements your sleep meditation [Music] [Music] you
