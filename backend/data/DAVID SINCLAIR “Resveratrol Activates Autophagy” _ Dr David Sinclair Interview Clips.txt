[Music] so [Music] as you know there was a couple there's phase one and two clinical studies on alzheimer's disease where they were given 500 milligrams or a thousand milligrams of resveratrol resveratrol day and both of these studies found that there was a reduction in amyloid beta 42 and cerebral spinal fluid there was an improvement in cognitive function and a couple of other parameters so it was kind of interesting because i recently had dr dale bredesen um on the podcast and he has this whole protocol where he's able to with certain you know diet and lifestyle factors you know improve um cognitive function and also by mri like help have shown to like reverse some of the um atrophy in the hippocampus and so resveratrol was on is he's got this long list and i kind of like everything in the kitchen sink where i was like geez like what is all the resveratrol was on there i never really knew why until i very recently was reading a little bit of the clinical studies i thought that was um super interesting as well and then the other thing that was interesting as you know is the autophagy because um resveratrol seems to be activating autophagy yeah and um i also interviewed guido cromer on the podcast you did and he talks about these three signals that are important for autophagy and one of them is the decrease in protein acetylation yeah yeah because her2ins are histone deacetylases right so that would lead to right a decrease in proteins that's exactly right so that's how these pac-man enzymes are working and one of the enzymes that they work on is an autophagy protein that goes and destroys bad protein so it's perfectly reasonable uh to think that if you take resveratrol it might be clearing the body of those proteins i have seen the study with with resveratrol yeah richard turner um i believe he's the that's the study i think you're referring to and it looked really promising and he did what looked like a very convincing study but uh he actually is still trying to raise the money to do his larger trial and i'm trying to help him with that but i would love to see that repeated and more people [Music] [Applause] [Music] you
