[Music] all right so what about the future well part of our future has to be off this planet and this is uh what mars life will will be like the other problem and i think elon fails to at least think about it or talk about it enough is what's going to happen to our bodies when we get there and that you know it's a horrible place out there we're very lucky to live on a planet with a magnetosphere and one of the big problems and i work with nasa big problem is that our dna and our control program of dna the epigenome is going to be toast it's a about a 900 day journey back and forth and that's enough time that you're going to come back with dementia uh premature aging probably some alzheimer's just to to say the minimum so one of the things that we've been working on is as a way of using the technology that we developed in my lab is to use that to actually help people get to mars and come back without uh dying and so we we submitted a proposal to to nasa and one of the things that nasa was looking for was a way to protect astronauts in near space and deep space and certainly on mars and one of their big problems is how do you shield a human being and some of the proposals were put a meter of water around the spacecraft or about a half a foot of lead which is fairly heavy uh one of the ideas that we had was why don't we protect the cells protect the genome and shield that and we have ways of doing that there are actually some new innovative ways to be able to prevent cells from getting damaged as well as repair more efficiently so i'll tell you a little bit about that the molecule that is is all the rage in my lab is this one this is called nmn it a version of this is in clinical trials over at brigham and women's hospital i've been feeding this to to humans for about 18 months now all has gone well so far and this is the molecule we had a science paper a few years ago showing that this actual molecule at least in mice protects those mice from dna damage and restores the dna repair capacity of an old mouse to a young one again and that's an important theme often we think that aging is a one-way street and what we've learned is that there are aspects of aging that are remarkably reversible uh the mice that we published on were treated just for a week and that was enough to reset that part of the program [Music] [Applause] [Music] you
