[Music] the genetic pathways that respond to adversity they've they're in all either in the trees they're in the food we eat um they're in our pets and they re they've evolved uh i propose in the book that it's a survival circuit that is very important to keep us healthy when we're young but it actually comes back to bite us when we're older when we're not needed and what they serve to do is to keep the body alive when times are tough the bacteria have survival circuits they have sirtuins the genes we work on in my lab um jellyfish yeast uh yeah we it's it's everywhere these sirtuin genes and and mtor which is one of the other survival circuit components ap kinase these are some of the oldest genes uh on the planet and they sense the world around us they sense how much meat we're eating they're sensing the temperature they're sensing blood glucose social energy they're sensing exercise and they respond when your body is threatened they will fight back and if you sit around and you eat a lot of food they'll get lazy they'll work instead on other things that are not helping longevity so when we're hungry that's a threat when we're running that's a perceived threat if we're eating food that's stressed the plants that we if they're stressed we get a signal we believe um if you're really cold or really hot and if you go from hot to really cold suddenly these are all shocks to the body that turn on these pathways that keep us healthier for longer and now we really understand why dieting and exercise are good for for us it's the turning on these survival systems now the word for this is called it's it's hermesis hormesis is essentially anything that doesn't kill you will make you stronger and longer lived and that's what what i do with my life i i try to put myself in a state of homelessness cycling through these perceived adversities that don't really hurt my body but they put my body in a state of high alert so the stress that i'm talking about is cellular stress meaning the cells might be pushed on temperature or on nutrient not enough nutrients uh but that's not the same as psychological stress unfortunately it's the same word but they're completely different things a little bit of stress i find um as long as it's not crippling and leading to physical decline i think is helpful i i find myself doing a lot of things that i regard as stressful a lot of adrenaline but not chronic stress you've got to be able to calm down and a lot of people use sleep and meditation and yoga to be able to mitigate those negative effects [Music] [Music] you
