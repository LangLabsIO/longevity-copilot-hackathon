[Music] foreign the good news is that people in the Aging field for the past 30 or 40 years have developed a series of longevity Pathways these pathways are Illustrated here this is just a subset of the known longevity Pathways in various organisms and from these longevity Pathways what has been found is that aging longevity is conserved from yeast to nematodes to flies to mice and to people that's my four then four-year-old daughter in the picture and so what you see is you have Pathways like insulin-like signaling that when you decrease insulin-like signaling which can't be done in the yeast because it's a single-celled organism you can increase lifespan and nematodes and in flies and in mice and there's a lot of good evidence that decreased insulin-like signaling is probably beneficial for human lifespan similarly dietary restriction which is defined as decrease in nutrient intake without malnutrition increases lifespan in all of these organisms and there's good evidence that will be helpful in humans decreasing the target of rapamycin pathway similar to decreasing insulin like signaling pathway also is a beneficial lots of organisms and then a couple additional Pathways we're increasing sirtuin activity is beneficial most organisms and more recently decreasing oxygen levels can benefit some organisms if you look at all of these longevity Pathways there's a single thing that comes to mind that they all share and that common denominator is stress what I mean by this is that insulin-like signaling in the target rapamycin for example are Pathways who get turned on in good times and so when the environment is good when your your brain and your other tissues have decided you've got plenty of nutrients there's no danger that you're under you're in a situation replete with food comfortable environment shelter Etc you turn up insulin signaling and you turn up Tor to help grow and reproduce and the downside of this is it tends to age fast to age you faster whereas when you have insulin like signaling decreased in mutations or when times are bad or when tour is decreased when times are bad this leads to an extension of lifespan because the body is the theory is that the body is hunkering down and preparing for tough times and hoping to wait out until there's better times similarly speaking dietary restriction is a metabolic stress in itself it turns on a lot of similar Pathways and certuins are also turned on in response to stress whereas hypoxia is also another stress and so this common denominator of all these longevity Pathways is they either are stressed directly or they turn on stress response pathways so that brings me to stress response Pathways the idea of hormesis what doesn't kill you makes you live longer and so to illustrate what hormesis is I have this graph here on the right and the idea behind this is that you have stress on the x-axis and then you have health and or mortality on the y-axis and the original idea is one of two things would happen the first is that you have no threshold you take a stress and this could be a toxin this could be uh an actual physical stress I don't try to use psychological stress although that's what people feel a lot especially during the pandemic I don't try to use psychological stress here although it is theoretically possible this would also be involved and the idea here is if there's no threshold every extra bit of stress will will make Health worse and decrease mortality now most stresses are not going to act like this the Assumption was that most threat stresses would act more like this in red this is where you have a threshold where a little bit of stress you can handle but you get to a point it's a breaking point where you cross this threshold and now you get Negative detrimental effects of stress this makes a lot of sense organisms can't you know aren't going to be harmed greatly by any little insult but if you continue to give insults you'll end up causing damage now hormesis is what seen very very frequently in the lab and probably in the environment as well that's the idea that under stress organisms actually get healthier under low stress and so this is called a hormetic effect and the idea here being that at really low levels of stress there isn't really much damage but you still turn on a lot of the stress response stress protection Pathways which help defend you against future stress or just protect the Soma as it is now obviously if this stress gets too too great you end up in a point where you end up with negative detrimental effects on health and mortality so these stress response pathways are really important in cell cellular and systemic maintenance and they've also been shown to be involved in delayed aging models and to correlate with longevity and what I mean by that is that organisms with stress response Pathways that are more turned on tend to live longer within species and between species organisms that are longer lived tend to have better stress resistance this makes a lot of sense since you would never want to make body parts for an organisms that's going to live 20 years that only lasts two years and likewise there's no reason for an organism that lives two years to make a body part that's going to last for 20 years if the organism is going to be dead within two years so this is the idea that the stress response stress resistance goes along with longevity foreign [Music]
