[Music] drugs are supplements well actually they're the same thing it's just that one's regulated and one isn't in a different way i mean they're both regulated but one is under the fda's control and needs a prescription in the u.s um and one doesn't and every country has different rules but in general um the drugs like metformin that we're going to talk about later you do need a doctor's prescription and supplements fall into a different category which are classified as food and food like substances that you can buy over the counter and that's really the main difference it's important to remember that a drug just because it's a drug doesn't mean it's any different some drugs are directly from plants or just slight modifications metformin which requires a prescription is derived from a plant just just modified so you just have to remember it's more about regulation than actually the substance itself well there is one more thing that i should mention that's really important the reason that the drugs are also in a different category is that they've gone through more testing and that you can be less worried about side effects because they've been through so many uh tests and of course with a drug you get the listing of all the side effects and you work with your doctor whereas the supplement world um you know for good or bad but you know mostly it's a concern is that some of these products are unregulated in terms of their their quality and this is a real problem that we can talk about which is what do you how do you know what's a good supplement trust what you're getting um and so what i would say is look for a company that has a good reputation so a company that's been around for a decade often uh you can find these these companies that aren't just pop-up you know often unreputable companies destroy beautiful companies they they pop up for a couple of years then they get a bad name they change their name so you don't want one of those the thing is look for the letters gmp good manufacturing practices because that means that they're they've been certified to produce a product that genuinely has what they say is in there and there are no contaminants as well [Music] you
