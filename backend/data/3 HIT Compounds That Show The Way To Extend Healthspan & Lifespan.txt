so briefly so briefly some some published data that uh here we're looking at three compounds in different classes uh fire flavor and tea on the left hand side there this is a compound that um is is appears in thousands of papers because it binds amyloids and is used to quantify the the the aggregation of amyloids such as a beta and that's because of of a fluorescence shift that happens when it intercalates and beta sheets in in a beta and other amyloids and uh this was something that was raised by Silvestri Alvarez in my lab a postdoc who thought is there any biological function to to this compound so it's a synthetic component it's also related to Pittsburgh compound B which is actually used to visualize amoids in In Living humans um second compound Alpha ketoglycerate well known as a TCA metabolite it's also a cofactor of many many enzymes involved in lots of different aspects of biology so a natural metabolite and then finally vitamin D which you you could classify as a nutrient and so we've been studying these in different projects over the years and and following to different extents but let me just point to some of the common features of these compounds so here is quantification and this slide is really aimed at showing you that wow you know despite the fact that these components are very different from each other they have these common aspects lifespan extension and now suppressing amyloid beta toxicity um just a few words on fire flavor and tea we engaged in a study in collaboration with Brian Kennedy and and many others by Buck Institute this one was led by Simon melov and we looked at a compound called hbx which is a relative of thyroid and T is a modified compound that also binds metals and we did a late life intervention study on a large number of animals and critical to this study was um as longitudinal so we're looking at the same animals time point after time point and in in this study we measured cardiovascular health we we measured bone health metabolism uh body weight and so on and uh the the briefly the major outcome of this study was was first of all a comprehensive understanding of the number of animals we really need to use to to make sense of the observations of an intervention I'd recommend you I'll show you the paper in a second I'd recommend you have a look at that the the the Practical outcome actually was uh an effect on on bone health so Simon was able to show that the mice lose bone densities as just just like humans in a very similar fashion and um he was also able to demonstrate that this compound hbx reduced the extent of of bone loss quickly AKG uh with Brian Kennedy's lab we showed that Alpha keto glittery extends lifespan and mice in in two cohorts this is pulled female and male data here um it's a modest increase in lifespan um but what was less modest was the effect on health span and we can really sum this up with with a couple of pictures here the the mice on the right are control mice and it's a very somewhat similar experimental design to the the previous work I showed you in hbx where we have older mice coming into the lab we're treating them from 16 to 18 months and then we're following our natural decline with age from from there on and in this case we use the Frailty index and this is a multiple uh parameter measure of of Health in these animals and you can see in the controls that the the animals are uh the hair is graying they're also losing here uh they have skin conditions and if this was a video you would see that there they're not so great moving around the cage here they're they're definitely normal older animals showing signs of aging in contrast the mice on the left have been fed a diet that's rich in AKG EKG tends to decline in humans with age and so what's probably going on here is that we're we're restoring the EKG to perhaps normal levels and you'll see quite startlingly the the health of the animals look better even just visually in terms of coat color Coke quality and uh and movement of the animals so this work from uh Azar assadi uh was uh you know measured something like 31 different measures of Frailty in the mice and with Brian we we really had a close look at this data and and I think it's telling us something important and exciting and very briefly you can imagine in a population of mice you have long-lived mice and short-lived mice and you have a period of morbidity where these animals are not looking good based on the metrics that we measured uh what we saw with the alpha key to literate mice Was Not only was lifespan extended for the population as a whole but the period of morbidity seem to be compressed and that's super exciting and for thinking about interventions in humans that not only is this a longevity intervention but it's also an intervention that increases Health Spa and also compresses morbidity which is of such a massive social and economic um uh Factor foreign [Music]
