[Music] so [Music] i became familiar with your work back in those days when i was actually doing doing research on these little nematode worms and i remember the some of your work was on resveratrol um and how resveratrol like helped to regulate one of these i guess longevity pathways um certain the sirtuins and how that was involved and basically if you could activate them in certain ones seem to delay aging so maybe you could talk a little bit about both sirtuins and also what resveratrol is oh sure oh let's start with sertuan so when i arrived at mit it had just been discovered that there was a gene called sur4 that when it was mutated would make the yeast cells live longer and a fair amount of work we figured out that the sur proteins which are enzymes that control gene expression genes on and off they would become dysregulated over time and we found out that's because they were being distracted by a whole bunch of dna instability that was accumulating in those cells but the lesson was that these sirtuin enzymes that were controlling genes were also controlling lifespan which was a real breakthrough no one had really expected to find gene regulators controlling aging we thought we'd find antioxidant producers and dna repair proteins that's not what we found not initially and so the stratuans became uh very interesting in yeast and matt cable line who's uh now adam's out in seattle um he's a leader in the field as well he came in and his first project in the lab was to put an extra copy of one of the surgeons number two sir two into yeast uh and those yeast lived thirty percent longer and later lenny's lab and my lab at harvard showed that this was through a process of mimicking calorie restriction if you have a lot of sertoins you get the benefits of calorie restriction or dieting um and other types of little stresses on the cell like heat and a bit of lack of amino acids and if you get rid of the sirtuin or sir two gene the real breakthrough was that now calorie restriction doesn't work anymore and that whole setup was the basis of most of the research that the field has been doing since in the sirtuin field trying to understand that concept of what we learned in the 1990s in our bodies and in mice and i'm lucky and happy to say that a lot of it is very similar in our bodies as well and when you say calorie restriction usually you're talking about for like like in mammals um and humans like eating 30 less than you normally would or something yeah well in the old days we typically would take out 30 sometimes even 40 of the food of the mice and they'd be hungry all the time and it wasn't very pleasant um with yeast if you're wondering how do you calorie restrict to yeast we just dropped the level of sugar in the petri dish i think it was five-fold and that was enough to make them live longer and but they still grew quite happily um these days um as you're aware intermittent fasting seems to kick these longevity genes into action the sirtuins still come on but you don't always need to be hungry you can eat you know four days out of a week or even six days out of week and still have a period of fasting that gets this sort of an activity up to levels that we think would be beneficial right yeah and there's there's certainly a lot of overlap um at least in the in the scientific literature between calorie restriction and intermittent fasting having beneficial effects a variety of beneficial health effects um but i do you know some of the differences would obviously be you know when you are intermittent fasting your you're shifting your metabolism from um carbohydrate glucose to fatty acid metabolism and you start to you know ketogenesis can kick in after at least if you're if you're doing a more prolonged type of intermittent fast so there's certainly a little bit of differences as well between between us well one thing that's that's interesting that connects everything um is so we showed in 2005 in a science paper that when you take a calorie restricted rat and look at its organs we looked at the liver and muscle the levels of one of the so two and genes number one we have seven of these genes so we looked at number one because we we only had an antibody in those days to number one uh it went up dramatically i think it was about five to ten fold in levels in the calorie-restricted livers and then we recapitulated calorie restriction in the petri dish we grew cells in serum from animals that had been calorie restricted and we found that that was also enough to stimulate this boost of sertuan production but getting back to what you did in andy dillon's lab we found out the reason it went up in the dish was because of having low insulin and igf-1 levels because when we put back in normal insulin levels in igf-1 the sirtuins went back down um and that was a nice link between for the first time in mammals the sirtuins calorie restriction and the insulin pathway [Music] you
