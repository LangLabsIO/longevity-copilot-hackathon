[Music] so i'm always talking to my guests about how to master their mindset because people like you are so fascinating because you've taken an everyday event and become a master at doing something so can i ask you when in your life you've most needed to really master your own mindset and what helped you and who helped you so every day i want to get better that's that's my mindset and i've been working towards this goal of helping everybody on the planet live healthier since i was age four so it's been a lifelong goal but there was a time where i almost quit it was too hard i was [Music] going through hard life with three kids tough marriage and then i my science was attacked by two of the largest pharmaceutical companies in the world they attacked you did you say they did they said my science is wrong one one of our discoveries the major one and a lot of people just believed the pharmaceutical companies because of course they know better than this one guy at harvard um so what i you know i was in bed for a week i couldn't get out i guess it's as close as ever i've been depressed uh but i'm i'm proud of myself that i was able to say well i can't spend the rest of my life in bed and i know when i die i'm going to regret not fighting so i got out of bed went back to work and pulled a team together and worked on this to see if it was true were we right or where we wrong we just needed to know and i it took about two years and then we published a paper in science that said yeah we were right and they were wrong and that took a lot of willpower and i found out that i was more resilient than i realized yeah i mean some of the best people in medicine and in alternative health have been attacked and besmirched in front of the guy who wrote sugar blues and the guy you actually discovered what child bed fever was septicemia they were both ridiculed um diminished and then they realized not later they were absolutely on target i mean the guy who developed septicemia actually died in a mental hospital it was a terrible thing and because he was the one who said it's doctors not washing their hands going from the mortuary to delivering a baby so first they attack you then they accept you and then they believe in you and then they usually say later well he was amazing so i'm glad you came back from that because it's very hard when you're innovative and and you get attacked by somebody as big as big farmer because they're so powerful but we live in a world where people are less likely to believe everything a drug company says in your and that's a good thing [Music] you
