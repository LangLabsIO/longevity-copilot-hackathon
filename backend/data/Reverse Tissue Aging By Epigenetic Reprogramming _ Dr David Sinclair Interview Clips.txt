[Music] we're pushing hard on trying to use epigenetic reprogramming on the brain we've had some success restoring the ability to learn in mice that we age rapidly and also in regular mice we can reverse that process it seems uh but yeah that's where we're going we're also looking for other ways to reprogram the animal and eventually humans in simpler ways than using an adenovirus and a gene therapy in animals the organs that have been reversed in age so far are the brain the eye we've done a number of different layers in the eye and it seems to help all of them both in the structure of the eye as well as the the function of those cells we've done a bit of work in skin others have in europe so manuel serrano has reported at least at conferences that he can reverse internal organ aging uh belmonte's lab it's the salt just reported muscle age reversal we are doing that as well uh so there's a lot of possibilities so the eye will be the first the first patient hopefully in two years to three years will know if it's working the good news about the eye is you can go straight into an efficacy phase two trial rather than waiting for human safety data so that'll be fairly quick if it works other organs you know i i don't know what it'll be i think possibly hearing loss uh will be a good one to tackle because it's also for a variety of reasons it's a high-end high-inmet need it's localized the immune system won't be triggered too badly so i would if i put my money it would be hearing loss but there are lots of things we can do from muscle to liver um [Music] there's there's spleen there's pancreas there's a whole bunch of organs that i'm excited about trying this in [Music] yeah we think that it's likely to be a universal effect so far we've we've haven't failed to reverse the age of any cell type from skin to muscle to neurons from mouse to human so which would that would be great news if there was a universal treatment um but i think we'll also find that there will be tissue specific combinations that can be applied for instance in muscle including an early developmental gene that helps muscle develop could improve the efficiency of that treatment as well so the answer is yes universal but probably in addition we can make targeted therapies as well [Music] you
