[Music] uh another important compound supplement that really plays into this and on the health circuit is very well known nmn and really how this interacts with something called nad why could this be an intriguing supplement potentially for people to take right well first of all i'm working in full disclosure i've started a couple of companies that are working on turning what are called nad boosters as collective group uh into drugs uh and so i was just on a call this morning actually the past two weeks i've been a lot of calls with hospitals who are trying uh nmn actually for covert 19 patients which we'll get to later the way this all works is that nad is a an essential molecule for life if we didn't have it we'd all be dead in 30 seconds or less it's like taking cyanide nad is vital for life many actually hundreds of chemical reactions in the body require it but what we also discovered in studying the sirtuins um and i want to give credit to my my former mentor at mit where i trained lenny guarente he co-discovered that the sertuans the enzymes the pac-man uh black women you want to call them um they actually so remember i said resvertrol makes them do this well without nad the enzyme is stuck like this it will not work so think of resveratrol and the polyphenols from plants as the accelerator petal and the nad is the gas and without the gas doesn't matter what you do and the problem is that certainly in mice and it looks like in people to many of our tissues um and certainly our skin we have less nad as we get older and that means our sotun defenses which are cleaning up cells and preventing scratches on our genome they work less and particularly with covert 19 patients it's been shown in early work that they have very low nad levels as well once they have the infection in fact the virus chews up the nad so what we're talking about is restoring nad levels back to a youthful level and allowing our bodies to defend themselves and heal the way we did when we were young [Music] you
