[Music] foreign which was discovered by a phenotypic drug screening fukuden is a class of polysaccharides which can be found in many sources of seaweeds so in this workflow Mouse and human cells were induced as in essence and oxidative or genotoxic stress after drug treatment cells will stand for the characteristic acid vinegar activity cells were then imaged and analyzed by a high content Imaging system so boasts analytic and cinemorphics can be identified using this platform we have screened that different libraries of natural products such as flavonoids fatty acids and polysaccharides so we found that some sort of guidance analytics uh Samra cinemorphics the best cinemorphic and synalytic for guidance were selected for animal studies so given the limited time I'm going to just to share some of the results of today [Music] as shown here for cutting one is a cinemorphic as it can reduce innocent green cells in a dose-dependent manner without reducing the total cell number so for coding one also selectively reduce uh senescence and such factors at the transmission level such as B16 D21 io6 tn95 and mcp1 international sales similar or cinemorphic activity of Forgotten one was further confirmed in other like human and cells so in Vivo after five day acute treatment of very old wild time mice food coloring one can reduce senescence in multiple tissues including kidney shown here it also reduce the number of p21 positive gamma data T cells in the spleen we also did chronic treatment after six weeks of treatment in the asses one minus data Peru mice for cutting one can suppress the overall aging symptoms and extend health Bank especially after two weeks of treatment besides it reduced issues in essence including kidney liver and others um to identify the mechanisms we collaborate with Dr Governor Noah's group and found that for column one uh might exists therapeutic effects through enhancing six reposition activity and improving uh DNA damage repair uh in the sixth dependent manner um overall by phenotypic drug Discovery we have identified that food coordins are no cinemorphics of analytics depending on their sources but we are currently performing um homage studies to further dissect the targets of coding [Music]
