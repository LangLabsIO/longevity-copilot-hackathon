[Music] so lp little a is is the strongest genetic cause of heart disease and cardiovascular disease in people and about 20 to 30 of people have the really bad form of little protein lipoprotein delay that makes a lot of it and very small particles so why is small cholesterol particles why is that bad turns out that if they're small they get into the into the lining of blood vessels more easily and they also get oxidized and oxidation is like a type of aging it makes hard arteries and lp little a the genes for that are the strongest for heart disease as i mentioned and you can check you can have a genetic test there are those commercial ones uh 23andme is the one that i used and my doctor looked at it and he said david you have the bad form you've got the one that's probably going to kill you if you don't do something about it and so that at that point i became much stricter about my diet and trying to get my cholesterol down which is now fully under control i i've been on a statin for since i was 30 because my family is super high cholesterol my grandmother had a stroke at age 30. so i i probably would be close to dead by now if i didn't do something about it so i i needed to turn to medicine but even the medicine wasn't strong enough it needed this diet and i've been pretty healthy over my life but my numbers cholesterol and everything else they've never looked better and i attribute that mainly to the shift in the diet that i've made so [Music]
