[Music] well that that's the ultimate bet that we'll be able to revive ourselves um if we're able to preserve ourselves with cryotherapy so that the the way it's currently done um is fairly brutal uh it's a freezing process um that does a fair bit of damage to cells i think that's it's going to be a real challenge to bring us back that said i can see new developments particularly with the use of hydrogen sulfide which we've published is is part of the longevity pathway uh coincidentally or maybe not coincidentally but yeah i think these advances will allow us to to be able to be revived from cold storage without even freezing perhaps you know go go under for a few decades or maybe longer we need to figure that out if we're going to make it to another another habitable uh solar system anyway in my view which i write in the book will take us about ten thousand years to get to unless we have a major breakthrough in uh in rocket propulsion uh but yeah i i don't think a lot about cry preservation because it's the the ultimate um way to uh to to be alive uh in the future my hope is that we don't have to get there and we can we don't have to freeze ourselves to be able to preserve what we've got um just while i'm on the topic our bodies are our open systems meaning that the entropy that occurs and the loss of epigenetic information that should be reversible as long as there's a backup copy we can take in energy as long as there's some energy in the universe and there's plenty of energy in the universe for the foreseeable future and so the idea that aging is is predisposed and we can we can't fight it justifies biology it defies physics [Music] you
