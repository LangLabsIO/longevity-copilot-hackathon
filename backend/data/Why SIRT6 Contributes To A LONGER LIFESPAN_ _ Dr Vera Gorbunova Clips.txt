[Music] the cause of aging so this is our dna as we live our lives it's subjected to all kinds of damages from external sources uh from internal sources just from our you know physiology and we have to repair it but as we repair it it's never perfect so there are always mutations that i introduce and this is one type of mutation it's called double strand break both strands of dna get broken and this is very dangerous because when it's repaired or if it's repaired incorrectly you can get these these are called translocations uh when a piece from one chromosome gets glued to another chromosome it happens a lot in cancer but what's even worse uh it results in so-called epigenomic drift um and you know this is like a very sad picture something is drifting away and that's actually what happens to our epigenome as we age because there are many of these events of damage and repair and things just don't come back together as they used to be so it you know to make it more clear so this is our dna in the cell in the nucleus when we are young it's organized very nicely there are some regions that need to be packaged very tightly other regions are open and active and everything works nicely but as we get older it just kind of unravels uh things open up that shouldn't be opened up and the things that should be open get closed and as a result the whole thing just doesn't work as well so i like this analogy of the sock drawer when we are young our epi genome is folded very nicely and it's very easy to find the right socks in the morning but as we get older it becomes like that because like you go in and out in the drawer right and you mess things up even if you're trying to put it back together it still gets messed up so this is the old epi genome and try to find anything here right so how do we how do we fold it back together because this is really what we are trying to achieve to find a way to take this drawer and revert to this original young state so we measure dna repair and what what turned out to be that there was a perfect correlation uh between how long these animals live uh or their species live and how efficient their dna repair was and then we wanted to understand why yeah so what's different between these long-lived species and short-lived species and we found one protein called cir26 that had very low activity in the short-lived species and high activity in the long-lived species and we could even take it from short-lived species in too long and their dna repair would improve uh and then we even identify specific amino essence we could mutate and make mouse 36 uh just as good as beaver circle here is a beaver you know that's our hero because they're very long-lived they can live you know maybe 30 years maybe more so we could find specific amino acids we could swap between short-lived and long-lived improved 36. so c6 protein is very interesting it's involved in repairing dna but it is also involved in putting chromatin back together especially those regions of heterochromatin that should be closed so 36 its normal function is reinforced this heterochromatin not to let things unravel and then we got very interested so here we see correlation with uh lifespan of the animals now what about humans will long-lived people have high 36 activity or would it benefit humans to have higher sex activity and here i want to show a family of centenarians so this lady is 115 years old in this picture and these are five generations of her descendants and now that she is holding her great-grand great great great daughter in her arms so these people called centenarians they are also many of them are exceptionally healthier they live independently they maintain employment and come back to the office almost to the age of 100 so they don't develop or they develop very late these age-related diseases so we want to really achieve that for everyone why any everyone could live 215 and stay healthy like that and see five generations of descendants uh so we collaborated with the laboratory of houston suh uh who was sequencing genomes of centenarians and we looked whether there are any mutations in this gene 36 that would be more common in centenarians and we found two mutations in the c terminus of celt6 protein and about the same region where we had differences between mouse and beaver so we took those two mutations uh we engineered them we tested how they affect the function of 36 uh and this is a dna repair assay uh we compare so this would be the wild type six like all of us in this audience have and this is 36 from centenarians so it was better at inducing dna repair so that makes sense right so better dna repair longer life uh it was also better at maintaining heterochromatin so these are this is our genome and only a small fraction of it in codes for genes like very small everything else are these repetitive elements or so-called genomic parasites lines and signs that actually unravel as we get older and 36 keeps them silent so we compared uh wild type 36 and cincinnari and c6 and how good are they at keeping line one element silent and cincinnati was better so it was better in these two different functions that are very much linked to longevity and the way it was achieving that uh was by binding to another very interesting protein called lamin a uh juan carlos mentioned laminae in yesterday's talk so this is a very important protein in maintaining the structure of the nucleus which would be the structure of that soaked drawer and here circles binds to it and the centenarian one binds more tightly and helps to maintain the whole structure more efficiently so we still come to the same the same idea of maintaining epigenome um and now another hero i mentioned the whale the longest lived animal so we were interested whether these animals are really good at dna repair because it wasn't part of our original analysis where we mostly had rodents so we took the whale that lives over 200 years we measured dna repair in the whale and it was three times better than in human so it's really difficult to beat human to anything we already long lived but the whale did it so it has even better dna repair and very accurate so in humans accurate repair events were just 15 percent and in the whale they were over 60 percent so they are very efficient and very accurate okay fountain of youth but this time with the animals uh and actually this picture just yesterday was told that it was chosen for the cover of cell metabolism so proud of it so now these animals around the fountain and the longest lived one is in the fountain the closest to the water so by using these animals we can actually get closer to understanding of all these factors that control lifespan but you know how do we apply it practically yeah that's the question how do we bring the socks back together uh you know from the old back to young right uh so we thought well we have to you know maybe use certain six enzymes so i showed you that you know it's supposed to be organizing the socks uh so this is the uh project we did in collaboration with steve horwitz uh we expressed 36 uh in fibroblasts from all the people of you know very fresh low passage cells for two weeks only and then we measured mutilation age of these cells and then nine out of ten so these were the control cells and these were cells with 36 the age went down so we actually rejuvenated them by expressing 36 and then we looked what genes change and the genes that change were responsible for dna confirmation dna packaging so all the correct processes we would have expected 36 to affect and then of course the question how do we upregulate 36. so we did a screen for molecules that activate 36 and other people are looking for them as well and we were particularly looking for activators of certain six monoadp ribosylation activity which is the one activity we found enhanced in centenarians and there was one molecule that was activating this activity and this is a molecule that is found in seaweed and as you know people in japan south korea consume a lot of seaweed and these countries have one of the longest life expectancies together with spain but maybe people in spain consume something else that's very good so this is the seaweed and we thought okay um you know and the molecule is not something that it's not a small molecule it's a polysaccharide called fucoidan um so we were not sure if it will actually penetrate the cells in the right way because it's a sugar it's a little bit bigger so we tried it on mice first so we took mice aged mice we gave them a diet with fucoidan for two months so they were just supplemented with seaweed and we measured their frailty score which is very similar to how geriatricians measure priority score of people and here you can see these are mice uncontrolled diet and they have higher frailty score and these were mice that were supplemented with fucoidan so their frailty score was lower so again you know eat seaweed this is very safe and maybe maybe it will help your epigenome so this is basically what my last slide so this is you know the process of aging this is the bad thing that happens to our epigenome but now we have strategies to reverse it um to achieve epigenetic rejuvenation uh there are many different ways that can be developed to this end juan carlos was talking about yamanaka factors also laboratory of juan carlos and manuel serrano are looking for other ways pharmacological ways to do the same thing we also find these epigenetic factors like 36 that their job is putting epigenome back together so that may be another strategy and this way we can actually not only slow down aging but achieve rejuvenation so i'm very optimistic about the future um i would like to thank people who contributed to this work so it's the work of many students and postdocs from my group it was all done in collaboration with andre sulanov who is here uh and many other external collaborators listed here in funding sources and thank you very much [Music] you
