[Music] simply we chose lactobacillus plantarum a specific strain of lactobacillus plantarum because there's some evidence out there that it will help increase production of folate and we want we want to be bathed in methyl donors and we want to be bathed in natural sources of methyl donors we actually stayed away from using supplements and that's a conversation that we can get into we just wanted a whole foods matrix or we want gut-derived um bethel donors and in fact we did successfully increase circulating methylfolate in our study population significantly uh so it was probably it was a combination of everything we can't you know just point to the probiotics influence because we were doing a you know a methyl donor rich diet with our greens and so forth but we did increase circulating methyl folate which was what we wanted to do so that was pretty cool to see that we did so yeah our a healthy gut microbiome makes a lot of the nutrients that we need and especially a lot of the all-important b vitamins which play a huge role in dna methylation a healthy microbiome acts on those all-important polyphenols that i was just talking about and changes them structurally to make them bioactive so they can go on and do their job on dna methylation it they help with absorption so they act on our food in really important ways and help us get in the body and then once it's in the body go about and do its work of course we also know a lot about the gut and the inflammation you know it's 70 of our immune system is housed around the gastrointestinal tract if we have an unhealthy microbiome or if we're exposing our microbiome to poor quality food we're going to stoke all sorts of inflammation or aka as people are saying now inflammation because this inflammation can really drive the aging process including biological age and including changes to dna methylation so for many reasons keeping our gut impeccably healthy has an important role in dna methylation and in slowing biological age there's just a couple of of thoughts [Music] you
