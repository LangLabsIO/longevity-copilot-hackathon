[Music] uh audience wondering if all brain regions are equally affected by the agent if not what's the most affected region and what too we can use to promote understanding of how agents affect the brain it's it's not clear yet um people are doing now clocks on various parts of the brain and doing imaging we can now do that even at the single cell level uh as far as i know the brain doesn't age differently according to the various clocks but i could be wrong um because we haven't finished the experiment but we are looking in my lab and others are doing this to look at various parts of the brain i mean clearly parts some parts of the brain break down earlier in people than others um hippocampus is you know a real problem for memory and we know that that breaks down but i couldn't tell you if that was the clock of that part of the brain ages faster than another part what i can tell you that's interesting is that we are working on brain age resetting we have the ability to infect the hippocampus in a mouse and we've taken the ice mice that are aged rapidly and we've restored their memory using our osk system and now we're doing all just regular old mice and that looks promising manuel serrano has published a paper that he can do this too and induce neurogenesis so the birth of new neurons in the brain so i think eventually we should be able to use this technology in the brain as well to restore old memories and the ability to remember well that's really amazing and we're looking forward to see that day [Music] so [Music]
