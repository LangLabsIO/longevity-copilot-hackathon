[Music] so what is NAD well the molecular structure is shown here on on the S it's a a small molecule very simple but it has many many different functions because N is a core enzyme That's essential to life and is found in every single cell of living things uh the enzyme can is very important or the coenzyme is very important for uh the function of over 400 enzymes you can imagine why this molecule may play a very important function in everything in life and this enzymes include some of the very important ones that are very important for Nativity these are s the PPS and the cd38 and so on if you look at uh the whole marks for aging that many people talk about I'm not really a big fan of the whole marks because I think it's a good starting point it does not address all the issues but if you look at nine best known whole marks aging almost every single one involves n and because over 400 enes are involved would requires require Ned for their function so you can imagine many of this important bial processes um do require n to function properly the most important ones are list under N and is involved in D damage and repair in oxidative stress in inflammation sellus inessence neutri sensing is important for supporting immune Health to protect the brain function improve glucose intolerance insulin sensitivity and on and on so you can read this SL probably faster I can read the bottom line is n plays such an important role in all biological processes and therefore it's also very important for anti-aging or to improve our nity the second um main reason why n is so important is that n is benev to decline with age or the data are not very uh abundant in the literature on the right side I have shown you some data that are generated in in Infinity where you can see the uh level of intracellular n on the Y AIS and on the xaxis you see different age groups I actually cannot see the right one hidden by the by the picture by um so if you look at a very young uh adolescence from 10 to 20 years of age uh the 25th percentile of int level is around 34 micro and that goes down to about 26 uh 27 micro more in the 20 to 30 years old and when you reach 30 to 35 years that goes down to about 22 micro and when you go to the above the 50s I can now see the number on my screen is probably around 20 micro more or so maybe 22 so this this data are from hundreds of individuals that will have analyed and this is the I believe the best evidence showing a age dependent decline of n in the human population now this decline in N is also associated with the no function and vitality and is related to many age related disase es and many of this um issues are many related to the Assurance uh that require Ned for the activation so a lot of people ask me you know what's the optimum range for for n i I get this question a not so I want to address it here so this is a very difficult question to uh to to answer for the moment I think the best thing that I can do is to take the distribution in a young uh age population here we taking um adolescence of 10 to 20 years old and I'm taking the 25th percentile that we see in teenagers so what it means is the 25th percentile means that 75% of the individuals have the levels and here the 25th percentile is at 34 micro so 75% of teenagers have un level equal or greater than 34 micro so I take this value as the lower end of the optimum range we can debate about this but I think this is a a very good starting point we have not been able to define the up limit of the optimum range and my personal belief is you probably don't want to get it over 100 micro because over 100 micro is not very often seen in any person in a natural way without supplementation or or Ned management [Music] n
