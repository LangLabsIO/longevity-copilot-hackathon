[Music] so how does anime work there's a lot of stuff in literature if you want to read about it basically we found a set of enzymes i actually when i worked down the hall here at mit 20 years ago uh in the guaranty lab we discovered that there are a set of enzymes that control uh gene expression and cell defenses we call these the sotuns and we have seven of those genes in our body and those enzymes that control uh genome stability and the epigenome need nad nad you'll remember from biology hopefully is a molecule that's required for many enzymatic reactions without it we're dead in about 30 seconds this molecule goes up and down during the day when you wake up you get a boost when you want to go to sleep you go down again nmn is the immediate precursor that our bodies use to make nads so we found that by giving nmn to mice and to people we've done now phase one clinical trials it seems very safe and it's able to boost nad levels in people by about twofold and bring those levels up to levels of when we were young the idea as you now understand is if we could boost those levels back up maybe our body would fight aging and disease and even covert 19 a little better than it did without this nad molecule [Music] [Music] oh [Music]
