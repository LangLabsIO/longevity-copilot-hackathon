[Music] so what's special about pearl it's it's a large-scale double-blind randomized placebo-controlled what's called a phase four trial phase four just meaning that you know it's already enough it's fda approved medication so we're not looking for fda approval it's already been approved we're just looking to kind of add data to the drug um and and it's going to be one of the largest if actually the largest so far a human aging trial on rapamycin and it's and it's groundbreaking in in many ways and we'll talk about those so we're going to be doing it in in multiple phases uh so far we've developed the plan for phase one and phase two so phase one we'll be looking at four dosing schedules we'll be looking at efficacy and safety valuation it's gonna include 300 participants plus 75 placebo phase two will probably remove the placebo we'll pick the best dose and we'll increase the uh the number of participants up to a thousand or more we may we may open the door up depending on demand and our capacity and things like that um we've we've scoured the literature and we've come up with fair for carefully selected dosage low dose medium dose and what's considered to be you know high dose now i just want to say that that all these doses are well below the dose that are that's used for um you know transplant patients and and it needs to be intermittent because you need you need time to recover um you know recovery from this calorie restricted memetic you don't like i said if you if you activate or so if you inhibit mtor all the time um then you get an immunosuppression uh and you don't want that obviously but so if you do a pulse dosing at what we think would be the right dose one of these one or more of these doses will hopefully turn out to be the right dose then then you get the anti-aging effect without immunosuppression in fact if anything we expect to see a uh immune boosting effect where you'll actually be more resistant to infection we have extensive inclusion exclusion criteria you can look at our clinicaltrials.gov for a full list and we'll also be publishing this somewhere as well um we're looking at um you know our primary our primary endpoint it's going to be it needs to be a clinical endpoint so we're looking at visceral fat as determined by dexa scan secondary endpoints we'll be looking at things like bone density adverse effects and then there are several objectives so in addition to the endpoints we have objectives for the trial so our primary objective or one of our objectives is to look at the safety profile of of these doses of rapamycin you know tease out to see if there's any you know side effects that stick out if there's any particular dose that has less side effects or more side effects and we'll also do a six month interim analysis so if the data looks good at six months we may actually cut the phase one trial short and move on to phase two and enroll more people and we'll be looking you know our first objective will be looking at things like cbc cmp things like that um looking at health surveys uh looking for side effect profiles objective two is a long-term efficacy um now obviously we can't wait you know 20 30 40 years for disease of ages aging to show up so we're looking at various different biomarkers and as well as you know some health surveys to help us determine whether rapamycin is actually helping with the aging process and there's been a lot of work i mean we're not the first you know there's been a lot of work on and looking at bio various different biomarkers um to help with the to help determine age biological age objective two is efficacy again we talked about you know we talked about that looking at various different uh markers here we'll talk a little bit more about those markers in a minute you know the the dna methylation clock uh on the illumina epic chip um you know um dr horvath he's very famous for his clock um using the uh cpg's methylation um dr levine morgan levine um she's come up with a way to kind of couple the uh dna the mid-dna methylation with the blood panel um and has come up with this um dna m pheno age um and we will be we'll be looking to include that as well um mtor assessment uh we're looking at different ways to actually assess the mtor and autophagy pathways um we're looking at uh including microbiome uh because microbiomes you know the bacteria in our gut is more of an organ rather than just standard and there's a lot of promise that if you if you improve the microbiome then you can improve somebody's long-term health objective three is to help roll out the rapamycin therapy on a much broader scale using our established telemedicine platform we've gotten a lot of inquiries about including arapamycin on our on our telemedicine platform um unfortunately unlike metformin which has got a very long you know very well established uh safety record and well safety profile um drugs like rapamycin and other experimental more expensive experimental therapies haven't really been studied as extensively uh and so need need this type of trial uh and more trials to in order to um to safely roll it out for for for the healthy individuals so that's what our that's what our objective is to study it assess it figure out what the best dose is because there's no there's really been no comparison on human dosage for longevity and then rule it out using our telemedicine platform um and like like i mentioned before we operate in all 50 states and we hope to expand that to other countries in the future [Music] you
