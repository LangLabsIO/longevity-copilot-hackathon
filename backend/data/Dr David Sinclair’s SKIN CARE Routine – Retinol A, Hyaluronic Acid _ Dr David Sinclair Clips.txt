[Music] what i do is i use a couple of or about three different types of creams at night i have a moisturizer which was developed in my lab and so that one has some uh bioavailable resveratrol and some other things that are very good there's betaine in there um small amounts of hyaluronic acid i think i'll talk about hyaluronic acid a little bit that's a it's a it's a string of sugars that cells use to remain plump and actually it can also defend against cancer and so i have a hyaluronic acid product but there are small hyaluronic acid pieces that go in so i take supplements but they don't they don't don't all get to the get to the skin and so um what i like to do is i use this topical cream uh that gets in at night it's got the moisturizers hyaluronic acid it's got these molecules in it the other thing that i do is um i'm actually mixing a little bit of retinol so retinol will increase cell division um and it does help with wrinkles so you know at 52 uh you know you're meant to have a lot of wrinkles so far i haven't gotten that many and i think part of it is is the retinol treatment i put it here and i put it here well so i use 0.5 percent uh which is i think a moderately high dose actually i don't put it straight on my skin because it can actually cause dryness i find i mix it with my moisturizer and apply it that way and so the amount that i put on my finger is the size of a about half a pee and i tend not to go close to the eyes because if it gets in your eyes it can really hurt but i do actually go higher than most people recommend i get under there and you know i don't have any bags or a lot of wrinkles under there and i think that's partly what's helping here's another he's a secret and a hack for the guys women who are having uh thinning hair uh i rob it here where you know i think it's it's prone to being thin and it's known that um that retinol actually lengthens the hair growth phase um and then the third thing that i applied to my skin um is a peptide that is thought to boost skin division as well and so together i think i have improved my skin over the years if you look at my photos from even five years ago and even 10 years ago my skin was not as good and so that's really shows that the power of science can actually work and all of these things i'm talking about today are backed by scientific studies people on the internet is claiming that i've had plastic surgery the answer is no i haven't done any plastic surgery um it's all natural [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] you
