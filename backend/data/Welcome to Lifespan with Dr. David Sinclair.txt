- Welcome to the Lifespan Podcast, where we discuss the science of aging and how to be healthier
at any stage of life. I'm David Sinclair, and I'm a Professor of Genetics
at Harvard Medical School. And I'm the co-director of
the Paul F. Glenn Center for Biology of Aging Research. A few years ago, I decided to write a book about why we age and why we don't have to. I loved every minute of the
process of writing Lifespan, but one of the things
I learned along the way is that it's hard to pack
everything you want to say into one book, especially given how fast the
science is moving right now. The other thing I learned is that I really enjoyed the experience of working with my
co-author Matthew LaPlante to explain the science to our readers. The conversations that Matthew
and I had were lots of fun. We laughed a lot. We argued a bit. But we'd always walk away feeling a little smarter
than we did before. Over the course of this podcast series, Matthew and I are reconnecting
to keep you up to date with the newest science in the field of aging and of human health. We're going to talk about
the latest in food, exercise, supplements, bio-tracking,
and age reversal. Our goal is to help you know what you need to be doing right now to reach your peak health and performance, and to learn about advances
that are just over the horizon. We're so excited to share this
Lifespan podcast with you. You can find us on YouTube,
Apple, and Spotify, and wherever you get your podcasts. Please join us by subscribing. Our first episode will go live
on Wednesday, January 5th.
