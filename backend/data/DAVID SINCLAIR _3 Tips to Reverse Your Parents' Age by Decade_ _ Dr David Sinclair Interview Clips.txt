[Laughter] [Music] yeah well i i literally do tell my parents my my father is a big advocate of this type of research and he's been following this for about a decade he's now 81 in perfect health no diseases mentally sharper than i am and so the three things that he's been doing are to eat less often uh so he eats one normal meal a day and maybe half a meal for lunch skips breakfast he walks a lot uh and also works out at the gym so he's keeping his muscles uh nice and and strong so he doesn't fall and break a bone which is a large cause of mortality in elderly people and he has a social life he keeps his brain active he has friends and these three things are some of the very simple things you can do to live up to a decade longer you
