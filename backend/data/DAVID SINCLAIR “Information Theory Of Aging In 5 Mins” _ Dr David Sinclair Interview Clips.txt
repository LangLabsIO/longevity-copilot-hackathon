so [Music] and what the main clue happened in in 1995 actually when we realized that these circuits are important for the aging process in yeast cells that we use for baking and brewing now the sirtuins they got their name because of a gene called cer2 in this yeast cell and and it's an acronym silent information regulator number two sir and you might notice that i is very important information so the regulation of information was controlling the aging process in yeast what it was doing was stabilizing the epigenome basically telling the yeast cell which genes should be on and off to be healthy and that became dysregulated over time and one of the drivers of that misregulation and nessa was dna damage and so now the theory possible to 2021 is that we have a lot of evidence from animals people that this is true for ourselves that dna damage drives changes to the epigenome and that leads to cells losing their identity so what i'm saying is that at the tippy top cause of aging it boils down to a loss of inflammation i could write an equation for you um it's basically the entropy velocity of information so what information am i really talking about it's not the genetic information that we that we struggle with there are mutations for sure going on this time you'll get mutation but what's really driving aging we find in my lab is that it's the other type of information the epigenetic information which are the systems that read the dna i think of it as the software of the body that gets corrupted over time i've used the analogy that if people can remember a compact disc the dna would be the music encoded and the software the epi genome is the reader of that music and over time you get you get scratches on the cd so you can't read the information that well and so what we've discovered was that not only can we accelerate that process by scratching up the cd or causing dna damage that accelerates this process in animals and watch them get old but we found that there's a backup copy of that information essentially you can either polish the cd or another analogy would be you just reboot the software and now the system runs like it should and that's how we got those blind mice to see again i mean that's incredible yeah but often people wonder how is it possible how could it be so simple um and it was a lot of trial and error we failed for many years of this but we hit upon a combination of using three genes that we turn on when we're embryos and keep us young when we're embryos but we don't use them when we're adults and so we turned on those three genes in the mouse's eye or in human cells or those mini brains we find that those three genes are sufficient to reset the age of the cell in a safe way cells don't become cancers they don't lose their age back to zero they go back about seventy percent in age and stop and then we take away the system we'll turn it off and cells and the eyes age out again and it was that simple and the cool thing about it is a that there is a backup copy we didn't know where if there was we still don't know where it is by the way we just know it exists somewhere in the cell um and that it was really simple once you know how to do it and what this really means is it's like the wright brothers it's you know you dream of flight for 10 000 years maybe a million years and all you need to do is to do a bit of math strap on an engine do some wind tunnel experiments and you do it and once you've done it then you know the future is inevitable just depends on how long it takes to build a 747 and go to the moon but you know that it's going to be possible [Music] [Applause] you
