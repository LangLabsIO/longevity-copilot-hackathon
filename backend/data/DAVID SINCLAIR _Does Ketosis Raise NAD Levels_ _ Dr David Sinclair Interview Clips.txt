so [Music] and so there's great interest in these compounds nmn and nr to raise nad but there are other ways we can raise nad as well right this is sort of my interest in ketosis ah okay uh yeah you you should be able to educate us ketosis will raise nad it does are you so there's a paper that i uh from uh 2018 the title of the paper is ketogenic diet modulates nad dependent enzymes and reduces dna damage in the hippocampus and so what they found in this experiment it was mice and they put the mice on ketogenic diets and they found that within two days um levels of part one and the dna damage decreased and declined fully after three days and they saw levels of nad increase with a ketogenic diet so this was kind of my fascinating question and then there's another interesting paper i found called ketones improve april protein e4 related memory via cer2 and iii and this was also done in um transgenic mice apoe4 transgenic mice and when they put them on a ketogenic diet they saw increases in cert iii um along with beta-hydroxybutyrate they gave them beta-hydroxybutyrate in this study and they found increases in nad to nadh ratio and benefits in terms of protection in terms of learning and memory for these mice so the question becomes we can increase nad by taking nr and mn aren't we also increasing nad by being in a ketogenic state [Music] right and in the time that you said that i've looked up the paper um it's super interesting it's a human study looking at um magnetic resonance spectroscopy so this is this doesn't lie this is real and it's in humans not mice which one is this uh i'm looking at um the one from 2018 oh got that one and so yeah ketosis increases nad nadh ratio in healthy human brain oh this is different paper different paper yeah a whole nother paper yeah the other one i was talking about was in uh mice and rats yeah but yeah this is even better yeah so yeah i mean based on that i would say it's super in super interesting that ketosis is going to potentially simulate or stimulate the same pathways um as clark restriction and exercise would right and so this goes back to kind of what i asked you at the beginning you know like you could um by checking ketones between meals now for you you could get a sense i mean those that beta hydroxybutyrate that you're going to measure that is probably affecting epigenetics we know that beta-hydroxybutyrate itself has epigenetic roles like i mentioned earlier it's an hdac one inhibitor so histone the acetylase inhibitor as well and it can affect foxo3 and potentially nan pt i need to find more research i don't know if anybody's looked at beta-hydroxybutyrate and nam pt but the like this is kind of another hypothesis that i advance in my book that there are multiple ways to get these benefits and a ketogenic diet might be one of them i call it living a radical life and we actually kind of talked about that earlier because the other things i advocate for are sauna cold stress exercise you know and ketosis these seem like these can turn on the same sorts of genes yeah i think uh you might be onto something here and uh and not only that these um these ketones such as butyrate they are also relevant to the epigenome uh because histones can be what's called butyrolated interesting yeah and uh and so what what we we've now realized is that these ketones and nad are very ancient molecules and uh the body has evolved even yeast cells to really adapt to what what's coming in as food and modulate the epigenome in response and now we 4 billion years later are figuring out hey if we just modify our diet in certain ways we can trick the body into thinking that times are going to be tough that we're running out of food or that we're getting chased by a sabretooth tiger and our bodies will fight for us against aging yeah isn't that [Music] [Applause] [Music]
