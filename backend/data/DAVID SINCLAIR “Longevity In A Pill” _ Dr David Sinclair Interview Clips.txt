[Music] so [Music] and uh this question is about longevity and appeal right we're so used to the concept that at least substantial part of medicine treatment is just something that we take orally right in the form of pill and in terms of the question is where are we in terms of getting longevity and appeal that would help to extend our health span and lifespan by at least 10 or 20 years is it something that you envision in the next decade well just by doing the the right things in your life eating the right food eating less often sleeping less stress exercise on average you can extend your lifespan already by 14 years so we're pretty pretty close just doing what doctors recommend so 20 years is not a big deal for me i think i'd be surprised if what i do in my life which is a bit more focused monitoring myself and and taking a few supplements and doing uh those things that that i'm not extending my life by 15 20 years already from what i would have done naturally if i just you know led a typical western american lifestyle but ultimately you want to go beyond that you want to have many people live beyond 100 and that to me doesn't seem very far away i think that the combination of what we already know combined with some pills like this is metformin combined with molecules that are in development uh such as nad boosters and mtor inhibitors there are a variety analytics when these and not if it's a when these hit the market over the next five years um i think the combination of all of these things uh could reach that that milestone uh will somebody break 120 122 i mean i'm optimistic that somebody will be able to do that because the people who live these long lives typically don't leave very healthy lives either and if they had i'm certain that they would live even longer though you know some would disagree some people think there's a limit to human lifespan no matter what you do i disagree there are many species that live much longer than us so in addition to pills other other applications include uh creams uh injections there's a whole variety of things we can do and and eventually gene therapies um there's no reason why we can't modify our own dna but in terms [Music] [Music] you
