[Music] the guidance for exercise was a minimum of 30 minutes at least five days a week using perceived exertion scale hitting 60 to 80 percent perceived exertion so you know movement that requires increased breathing but you can still hold the conversation sort of the range of that so you're you're you're you're getting some movement in but you're not um uh up towards max and again yes our it was our read on the literature exercise is fabulously beneficial um and again you know let me just say that i am not advocating that we all do that type of intervention forever it was for this program and we were trying to uh you know it has to be as one size fits all as possible you know when you're doing a study um too much exercise or pushing someone who's a couch potato towards an aggressive exercise program would be problematic and we would see aberrant negative changes under lack of movement likewise is associated with problems and and and that's corroborated in the literature specifically relating to dna methylation and i think in our paper you'll see a handful of citations um more evidence is coming out showing exercises beneficial to aging of course and specifically as measured by dna methylation we needed an easy turnkey sort of validated tool that we could readily prescribe that didn't have a high learning curve that didn't require you know years of practice prior to and benson relaxation response is that it's it's just a very straightforward tool for those folks who are just who are new to a meditation practice and so that's why we chose it and the data you know appear pretty clear that people who've got a good solid meditation practice or you know are engaged in yoga or tai chi and you know other other programs have younger biological ages and you know what's interesting too is you can see some you know apparently favorable epigenetic changes and that's not not to biological aging but just sort of moving in the direction of favorable changes even in new meditators and people without a lot of experience sort of suggesting that you know they're on the right they're on the right path so um the other piece you know as i wrote about in the paper is well first of all there was a interesting study looking just at the relaxation response and seeing favorable outcome in age reversal and healthy individuals and i cite that in the paper but um the other interesting piece is the you know the the paper again out of horvath's lab where they look at the um you know the 2013 clock that we used and and show that you know up to 25 of those cpg sites are our glucocorticoid response elements you know just suggesting that stress um particularly in the horror bath and that particular clock i mean was a potent driver of aging i mean it's really kind of mind-blowing [Music] [Music] you
