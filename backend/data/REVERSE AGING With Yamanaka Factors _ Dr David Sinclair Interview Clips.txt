[Music] so yamanaka shinya yamanaka is now world famous for his experiment looking for transcription factors mainly that are turned on during embryogenesis and he and his team looked at many different combinations and hit upon a combination of four factors which are of course now known as uh yamanaka factors um and they're they're called arc forsox to klf4 and cmec semic is an important one to point out because it's also a potent oncogene which is dangerous and that's the main reason that dr yamanaka confessed to me that i think it was it was sensible to put his genes in an adult but as you'll see it actually might might work so what he did was ask the question can you do the cloning experiment but in the dish can you get an adult cell to be h0 again and if you can do that you would have a pluripotent stem cell that could be turned into other tissues so cloning in the dish and it worked he was able to create many different cell types including skin these stem cells that we now use to generate little mini brains called cerebral organoids and new tissues and inject these also back into patients so he won the nobel prize with john gordon who did the tadpole nuclear cloning experiment in 2016 they won the nobel prize now a few labs took that finding from yamanaka and asked the question what would happen if you did something like that not in the dish but in a tissue or a cell from an animal and put it back into the animal what would happen and that was a big risk right because you could easily end up with a cancer a teratoma basically cells growing out of growing like an embryo but in the animal uh which does happen actually if you turn on all of the yamunaka factors but uh we we tried it anyway um so that there are two states that we we're finding if you go all the way back to what yamanaka did then you're losing the cell's identity there's a there's an intermediate step that we're using where cells get to a younger state but they stop we're interested in aging in every tissue the eye was a good model system to start with the virus the av the domesticated virus that is using gene therapy was pioneered in the eye so we thought that was a good place to start and also young nerds very young nerves and neonates still regenerate but you know young kids don't so we thought well let's see if we could do that but often i'm asked the question and it's an important one did we choose the eye because it had a better chance of working and the answer is no we could have tried to regenerate the liver the skin even the brain um and we only chose the eye not only but but one of the reasons actually is that the student in the lab who did the work mainly yuan cheng liu his family has an interest in the eye and has a company that is trying to use stem cells to reverse vision loss and so he had that passion i said okay go for it i think the liver would be better but i'm glad he did that because it's a very clear reading when you see the optic nerve grow back um but that was that was the first experiment we went on to treat glaucoma and even old age vision loss is the the traumatized optic nerve uh that was pinched and there's a an orange dye that you can see that when the nerves are dying back unhealthy those nerves don't take up the dye and so the untreated eye will will lose its vision similar to the breaking of a spinal cord what we did in the other mouse was to turn on the three yamanaka genes o s and k for three weeks and have a look what happened and remember david this is after the damage had occurred we weren't prepping the cells and what we found and this was a remarkable day my student texted me that the result you could see that the nerves were growing back towards the brain in fact if we leave them for 16 weeks many of those nerves actually make it all the way back to where they meet the brain again the chiasm which is a is a first this hasn't been done before as very little you can do for damaged nerves but then we looked at the age of those cells and two interesting things came out was that the damage accelerated aging according to the horvath clock which we didn't expect i mean who knew that damage would accelerate aging but it does and then the reprogramming factors uh delayed and reversed that age so that they they became young and could grow back again [Music] [Music] you
