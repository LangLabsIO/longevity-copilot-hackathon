[Music] so let me just sort of our our amazing finding and kind of our first first of its kind it got a lot of attention um because we were able to show in eight weeks time our participants shaved off three point two four years of their biological age in it and it's just it's still the shortest time frame to show that degree of biological age reversal the foods so a lot of these were well aware of and we know that they're smart we packed the diet full of kind of the classic methyl donor nutrients so lots and lots of greens good greens not those micro the micro greens that some of us really like not you know iceberg or romaine but nice dense green greens if spinach and kale we did a lot of cruciferous veggies a lot of colorful beautiful veggies but ones that are low glycemic so we don't want you diving into potatoes or even necessarily doing a ton of sweet potatoes although those are okay we want you to think about you know different varieties of peppers and uh you know different just survey your fruit and vegetable selection hopefully you've got access to good ones at a grocery and just by far and wide we had at least seven cups of these good veggies per day we also have beets in our study not a ton of beets because you know there is sugar and beets but two medium-sized beets and these have a compound in them called betaine they actually have a host of compounds in them that are brilliant um for methylation so again thinking about dna methylation but patane is one of the main players in beets so we want people to be getting two of them per day also you know berries berries are you know kind of miracle fruits uh as far as dna methylation goes so you know if you can go for organic as much as possible go for wild as you're able to access them but you know things like blueberries and blackberries strawberries you know just the nice dark uh good berries nuts and seeds are a big part of our program especially sunflower seeds and pumpkin seeds again dense with these methyl donor nutrients eggs smart if you're not allergic to eggs or you're not a vegan eggs are full of a compound called choline it just helps it's a key methyl donor and it just plays a good important role in dna methylation and again biological age reversal yes vegetables are the cornerstone of our diet but we also had some animal protein this is a uh you know a diet that includes both you know animal protein as well as you know veggies and so forth we we do incidentally have a vegan program now which we're studying and i can speak more about later but for this program it did include animal protein we want people you know those adventurous folks to consume liver if you're willing to just a few times a week liver is the original multivitamin mineral i mean before we had b vitamins before we synthesized vitamins people were prescribed liver and a lot of it so if you were anemic for example you'd be prescribed liver if you needed b vitamins you'd be prescribed liver etc so we included that clean source liver adequate water um we pull out pro-inflammatory foods like dairy and and simple carbohydrates it's a grain free this eight-week program is grain free we also took out legumes uh primarily we don't want people to stay off legumes forever there's you know fabulous when you look at centenarians who are living today so if you look at blue zone research you see that many legumes are consumed in those populations and they do well and they're healthy but just for this little eight week chunk of time we wanted to keep the glycemic index low so we really wanted to minimize spikes in sugar and just keep blood sugar relatively low and so we kept the diet in that in that direction sort of lower carbohydrate higher fat we incorporated some modest intermittent fasting we wanted the diet to be kind of keto leaning so we asked people not to eat after seven and not before seven so just a 12-hour window what else did we do you know again adequate hydration um we lean on a class of nutrients we're calling methylation adaptogens um these are epigenetically bioactive nutrients uh that we wanted people to consume really at every meal these include curcumin uh green tea rosemarinic acid and rosemary a host of different herbs like thyme and sage and so forth uh many fruits that we consume many vegetables that we consume have these polyphenols that are epigenetically active and seem to help direct dna methylation towards a biologically younger profile [Music] [Music] [Music] [Applause] so [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] you
