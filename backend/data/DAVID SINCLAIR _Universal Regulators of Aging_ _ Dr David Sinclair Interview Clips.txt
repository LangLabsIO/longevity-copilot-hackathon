the audience was are there any other organisms that have managed to sort of hack their system or that don't age or you know stay young in some way can you elaborate on some of the things we've seen in that area yeah that there are so we know it's not just to fight that argument that it's not natural or whatnot yeah well there's a lot of excuse me a lot of species that are better than us at this and they've managed to maintain this system and we see that in bow head whales and aspen trees that can live in that case for thousands of years that these longevity genes that we have but we don't keep on unless you know even even with exercise and diet we can't keep them on forever uh we've lost that ability whereas these long-lived species we think are just lucky enough or at least have evolved to keep them on short-lived species you know take a large dog for example or your pet cat they're unfortunate because their longevity systems are switched off even more than us so it's very sad but i think that we all have the capability the same with this reset switch there are species that um can live forever there are jellyfish that can respawn and become young again and we know this is possible in mammals because we can clone mammals in fact there's no reason why we couldn't clone a human if it were ethical and allowed what that means is the instructions to build a new organism are still in our bodies we're just not turning it on when we're adults so what i think is going on is that species like these whales and particularly jellyfish and maybe salamanders they can grow new limbs and lizards that grow new tails or lobsters even yeah lobsters there's negligible senescence we call it they don't edge they keep these systems on and now we're finally learning with modern technology how to turn these systems on like they do glenda did you have a couple questions for david yes a couple but i what you've discussed so far has been extremely interesting i just had two maybe small questions um david i think you said in the book that there are universal regulators of aging in does every human have some of these aging regulators and do super agers have more of them oh good questions uh i should be jotting these down to get to all of them we have a recording right uh so the simple answer is uh we all have these genes they go all the way back to little worms and and yi cells but we have different variations of them and some people are very lucky they have there's one called foxo3 and some people have variants of foxo3 changes in the dna code that protect them without having to exercise and diet they're like they're the lucky ones and those people are the super ages they can you know smoke and are immune to it whereas most of us we don't have that benefit uh we can't say oh just because someone lived to a hundred smoking me means we can all do that we're not lucky genetically um the good news though is that only about 20 to 30 percent of our longevity in health in old age is inherited we know this from twins who live very different lives and twins can live very differently life spans by living differently and so this is what epigenetic means it means that your dna is not necessarily your whole destiny you can make the best of the genes that you've been given and that's part of the exciting thing is that aging is malleable and that it's not so much the genetic code that only determines your lifespan it's how those genes are controlled the so-called epigenome that can be reset now [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] you
