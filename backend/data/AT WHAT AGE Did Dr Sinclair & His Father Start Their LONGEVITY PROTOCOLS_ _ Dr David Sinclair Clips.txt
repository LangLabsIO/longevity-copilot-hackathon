[Music] i started when i was 34 and that for me was was the time to start because technology had reached a point where we knew enough to start doing something about it but if if i had this knowledge now uh that i have now when i was in my 20s i probably would have started earlier um but i agree with you i think teenage years and early 20s probably not um late 20s for sure i mean here's what i do let's start with what i would do if i was born again i would say all right i'm now i'm 20 i'm gonna look after my health keep my weight optimal and i'm going to work out at the gym or do pilates and start doing some aerobic exercise that's the minimum i would love to have started a healthier diet when i was younger i think most 20 year olds don't care what they eat most of them not all and i was one of those people i would just eat pizza and it was fine um then in my late 20s i started putting on weight and even though i was eating the same thing so i stopped eating breakfast and he started when he was in his late 60s and so the good news about his um anecdote uh his story his experience is that it seemed to really help him he was even in his late 60s pretty lethargic not very optimistic not looking forward to his 70s he retired and was pretty bored uh and he went on resveratrol and felt an immediate benefit um that's his uh feeling about it and we noticed it in him as well then in the 70s he started just get fitter and fitter and he did more exercise um and then in his mid to late 70s he went on nmn um he started eating less often not eat not less but less often and uh that combination he's now when you if you saw him andrew you'd say this guy doesn't sound like an 82 year old he's just like talking to a 30 or 40 year old um mentally physically he's got no no ailments no diseases no lethargy he can he can run do anything he wants and he's now looking forward to the next 20 years of life and he started a new career and he's got a huge social life and uh and so we actually literally will never know if what i just told you is working for him um but i can tell you that that our family doesn't live a long time we tend not to be that healthy we have high cholesterol and tendency towards obesity and and bad ashkenazi uh genes from hungary on his side um and he's outliving all of our relatives and his friends at this point so it's it's pointing in the right direction and if nothing else he's a beacon of hope for all of us [Music] you
