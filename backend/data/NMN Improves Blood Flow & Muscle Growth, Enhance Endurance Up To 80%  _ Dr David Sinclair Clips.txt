[Music] yeah so we worked on this for many years so i think it's it's more than what we think we really have strong evidence of what's going on and if anyone wants to look this up in detail we published it in the journal cell yeah what we found was that the sertuan called number one cert one is really important for sensing exercise not just in the muscle we've known that for many years but also in the lining of the blood vessels within that muscle and when when you exercise you have a protein called vegf that tells blood vessels to grow we all know that if you lift weights and especially if you run you'll get more blood flow in your muscle it's also true for the brain by the way and loss of blood flow in the brain is a large cause of dementia of which we have nothing to to treat really certainly not to grow blood vessels safely but what we found was happening in the main in the mice was that the nmn was tricking the cell into thinking it was exercised and it was now responding to those uh those signals from the muscle and building new blood vessels even in the absence of exercise and what was happening in those old mice was that their the blood vessels were basically just not getting the right signals so that they lost blood flow which is a major cause of morbidity in in the body and disease and it was shocking to me that nobody had figured this out before because it's so important and so through a lot of experiments where we made mice that had more certain one in their blood vessels or knocked it out so they had less and showed that those mice were either fitter or less fit and doing that in the context of nmn we are pretty sure that what's happening is that those cells uh when in a normal mouse what would happen is you run you have low oxygen the blood vessels get the signal to build more blood vessels over the next uh week or so and we could mimic that with enema and the good news is that if we combine dna men with exercise it made the mice even fitter they couldn't go through go through endurance they could run on the treadmill for up to twice as long as their untreated counterparts but the message here is it's not sufficient to just pop a pill probably uh but it's also not an excuse just to sit around and pop a pill that getting off the chair running a bit uh will will be the the best combination based on those mouse studies and um so the the disease that we'd like to treat is called friedrichs ataxia which uh patients suffer from low energy um and i think low blood flow and we'd like to use nmn as a way to not animate but a molecule like nmn that's we think even better than nmn that will help those patients but ultimately if we can get a drug on the market then doctors can try it in clinical trials and and it's probably going to be a very safe molecule so it can be tested on a variety of things you know i'm sure if we ever get there um athletes might try this as well but that's a that's a whole different story [Music] you
