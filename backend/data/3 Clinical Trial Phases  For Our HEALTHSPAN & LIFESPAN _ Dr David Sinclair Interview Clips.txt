[Music] well i can i can think of at least a few stages the first stage is what we're doing now which is n of one studies showing at least in some individuals that with with your own self as your negative control starting point measuring um blood biomarkers including glucose but also and including epigenetic age and telomere length that's still part of the determinant of your ultimate longevity and and learn that way very quickly already in over the last year we've seen some some successes we've actually seen also some published papers where changing lifestyle mediterranean diet exercise some supplements alpha ketoglutarate seemingly reversing slowing if not reversing age so that's that's stage one that's self-experimentation or in a small clinical trial with each person being their own um control the next stage would be to have hundreds and perhaps i said millions of people who are being monitored and then you give them intervention a and not intervention or a group that has not no intervention and then you can learn that way in in lots of people and that would be done perhaps in by the public rather than in a hospital setting and that would be a lot quicker and cheaper of course and then the third way would be the traditional way but that's that's expensive a trial would be 30 to 50 million dollars but the standard way would be double blind placebo control intervention people come into the hospital get measured and you have to do multiple hospitals um and run it for four or five years and have a look at their frailty of course all the blood the biomarkers that we want to measure in the previous studies i mentioned and then um if you do enough people uh you can actually also do lifespan but that's that's a lot of people that's that's thousands of people over age 70 that we need to do that but at a minimum through all of those those three steps we'll have a good idea as to whether aging can be slowed in humans will it be proof that you can extend lifespan no there you need um really a lot of people um and uh and down under double blind placebo controls which is tough right if you're doing it for a decade it's not easy so that would be stage four but i think we'll get there in our lifetimes we'll be able to say that this molecule extends lifespan and in the meantime we are relying on these um epidemiological studies such as metformin where tens of thousands of people have been looked at and they live longer on uh type 2 diabetics live longer on metformin than people who don't even have type 2 diabetes and don't take the drug which is an astounding observation but the real proof if you want to call it proof has to come from prospective studies not retrospective [Music] [Music] you
