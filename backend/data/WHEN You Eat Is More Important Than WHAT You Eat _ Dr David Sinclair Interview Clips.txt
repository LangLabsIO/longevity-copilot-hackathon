so [Music] answer often we wonder what should we eat which is more important protein carbohydrate fat or is it more important when we eat and my colleague raphael de cabo at the national institutes of health in bethesda he did an experiment that he got completely opposite exp um from expectations what he found was that it didn't matter with whether he fed his mice a lot of fat a lot of carbohydrates or a lot of protein in different combinations he found that if he gave it to them only for a couple of hours a day those were the ones that always lived the longest so it's probably more about when you eat than what you eat to some extent you can't just go eat you know fatty hamburgers every day and expect to live longer either your lifespan and how you live how you'll be in your 80s and hopefully 90s is really in your hands you know we often think well it's in our genes dna is destiny that's not true how you live what you eat when you eat when you exercise and you don't need to do a lot of it you know i do you know a few times a week in the gym it's not a lot um i don't run marathons i'm not that active but a little bit goes a long way you know skipping breakfast once in a while maybe every day if you can running a little bit lifting weights making sure you're flexible these will ensure that you have will help ensure you have a really productive healthy enjoyable old age and the longer you live the longer chance the better chance you have of living longer so yeah please don't fear aging uh it's in your hands and hopefully i've given you some things to think about to live longer and there's a lot more of course i wrote about in my book that if you if you've read it as you've done adam um there's a lot more you can actually do and it's not that hard [Music] [Applause] you
