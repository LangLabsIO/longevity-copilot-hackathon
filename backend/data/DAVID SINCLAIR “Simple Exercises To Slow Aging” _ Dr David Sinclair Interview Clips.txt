[Music] so [Music] the what i do that's next probably most important uh is maintaining my body's uh weight which includes exercise and i really don't like exercise um but if i so if i can do it anyone can what i do is uh so right here i have next to me a little speaker for music so i agree music is always around to keep me calm uh and i have some weights here and so when i'm not busy or i need to stand up normal like this is a standing desk that i can push up and down i'm sitting currently um move just move whether it's a walk or pull up some little weights that aren't even that heavy just move those do this i try to keep my hips in great shape because that's one way to die as you get older by falling and breaking your hip oh tell me more about that how do you keep your hips in great shape because i love that because that is the thing so many old people fall they fracture their hips and then that's really a problem so sit down sitting is a major problem in in our lives i had to sit down to write my book for two years and i literally could barely walk with i had a limp because i had a cramp in my piriformis muscle that wouldn't go away but with regular exercise i it did go away and so i i think that the exercise what's called hip hinges so you you lean forward and you pick up a weight so you keep your shoulders back you lean forward till horizontal pick up a heavy weight uh for me that would be probably 100 pounds something like that but if you're older you don't need to lift that much and then just stand up till you're straight and then put it down again and do that 10 times are you leaning forward so you're like hinging like that so you're like a number seven if you like is that how you lean you lean from the hips exactly so you hinge over from the waist and keep your back straight you don't want to bend that and you pick up a waist with pick up a weight with straight arms and then bend them is that right keep your arms straight the whole time as you pick it up so you're picking it up sort of like that no you'll stand up and your arms will be at your side yeah go to the front and then just lean forward and put it down again and then keep doing that with your arms straight down so you don't lift your arms up you just lift the weight off the floor so a bit like a kettlebell is that right you can use a kettlebell that works fine yeah but you don't lift your arms up you just lift your body up right okay we can all do that [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] hey team it's dr baird at evolve performance healthcare today we're going to be going over the weighted hip pinch this is a progression from the hip hinge exercise and so what we're going to do is we're going to use a kettlebell and all we're going to do is we're going to start with the weight in front of us so we're using a kettlebell it can be any weight and i'll go from the side so you can see a little better and so what we're going to do is we're going to do the same hip hinge that we did before so the main thing that we're keeping in mind is that our back is going to stay in that neutral position and the only movement is going to be at our hips so from here what i'm going to do is i'm going to send my hips back my shins are staying vertical and my back is staying in line so this is about as low as i can go i feel tension in the hamstrings so from there we're just going to do the reverse hip hinge and stand back up keeping the back flat so one more time at full speed what it's going to look like is down and up so the main thing here and a lot of mistakes that i see people make is with the weight in front they don't start the movement by sending their hips back instead they just bend forward at their low back and then they round there so to really get this movement right we want to make sure that we're sending our hips back and then at the bottom all the tension is felt in the hamstring so one last time hips back shin staying vertical tension in the hamstrings there standing back up there you go that's the weight of hip hinge thanks so um i've read a lot about how you believe that exercises i mean i've read that before that exercise is one of the second most powerful ways to slow down aging but that one you believe is perfect for the hips is that right right and you walk better and actually the the slower you walk the it's a predictor of how long you're going to live and so you want to maintain your ability to walk um it's just a good sign of your overall health and and lack of frailty there's another test you can do which is how quickly and easily can you get up off the floor with crossed legs i've done that one i love that how do you do cross legs and crossed arms you cross your legs sit down and get up again yeah and you just keep practicing it yeah that's an indicator of how you're going to age isn't it it sure is and middle-aged people tend to have to put one hand on the floor and older people have to get on one knee and it's an indicator of the strength of those muscles in your core that's all it is and it's important you maintain those so when you're saying exercise there must be some exercises better than others so what if someone said well i do yoga every day or pilates are there particular exercises that are better than other exercises uh well i think it's a combination they're all beneficial so certain types of yoga will strengthen your muscles um and that is just as probably just as valuable as lifting those weights but you also want to keep up aerobic exercise but the good news there and i can say this because i really don't like losing my breath it's a horrible feeling is that you can you can do 10 minutes a few times a week on if you have a treadmill or go running outside when it's warmer and just 10 minutes has been shown to be greatly beneficial you don't have to run for miles to get the benefits but you do want to put your body in a state where you're so puffed that you couldn't carry out a conversation and that again puts your body in this defensive state it in you know what is a million years ago probably our ancestors were running around on the savannah and that's what we're built to do our bodies if we're sitting around eating all the time and not feeling cold not feeling too hot our bodies become complacent and they don't fight back against disease and aging if you can't run because you say one of my knees have gone on i live on a hill what do you think about rebounding using a mini trampoline getting out of breath that way great yeah i've done that before too especially in winter it's useful yeah do you think that's as good as running if you really work up a sweat on it and yeah absolutely because i heard that the anti-gravity part of rebounding was the aerodynamic was really good for your lymphatic system do you think that's true makes sense no i hadn't heard that that's really interesting okay [Music] you
