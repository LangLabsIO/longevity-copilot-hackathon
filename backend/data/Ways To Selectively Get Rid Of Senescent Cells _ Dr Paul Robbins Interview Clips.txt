[Music] again just reiterate we don't think sailor senescence is the only target for aging there are probably numerous targets but we focused on it because it is an important target and it's something that we have demonstrated in animal models works to extend lifespan so let me just describe a cellular senescence so what happens to cells if they're damaged and this could be if they're radiated or exposed to smoking and are exposed to uv they shut themselves down and what they do so this is these are cells in culture and in these cells they've been irradiated to cause a lot of dna damage and what happens to these cells is they change their morphology and they change their metabolism so these are cells become senescent because they become damaged just like they would in your liver kidney or brain with aging in these nested cells what they do is they release inflammatory proteins and the reason they do this is they want to stimulate the immune system to come in and get rid of these bad cells so these are cells that become cancerous but they can also lead to a variety of adverse events so our body wants to get rid of them so the immune system when we're young and healthy comes in and clears these cells the problem is as we age our immune system doesn't work as well so it doesn't clear these damaged cells and the amount of damage in our body has accumulated to the point where we have too many cells and it starts to overwhelm the immune system and so we think these damaged cells that secrete inflammatory proteins that accumulate with age can help drive the aging process itself so to visualize this in a different way the way we like to describe this it's like the bad apple in a bushel so as that bad apple spoils which is like a nested cell it releases factors that drive the other apples in the bushel to spoil and this is something we've seen with a variety of different fruits and vegetables and so if you think with age and time if you accumulate these cells and then they start to spread this these factors that lead to aging and damage in other cells what this can do is damage the tissue and drive aging and so one of our goals of numerous minnesotas identify drugs that will actually kill those senescent cells and eliminate them so they don't damage the surrounding tissue so an interesting concept but at this point a lot of proof of principle demonstrating the feasibility so how do we do this so i'll give you a couple of examples one laura and myself and a number of other labs have just studied senescent cells what is this nexus cell what does it look like and what does it do and this by studying senescent cells we've identified that we can use specific dyes in this case one that will turn senescent cells blue to identify a senescent cell and separate it from a non-senescent cell and we can do this in the animal and the human or in this case in the laboratory and so using this ability to to identify senescent cells because we can turn them blue this now gives us the opportunity to do drug screening and drug development so in this case we have cells we can grow in culture and we can stress them we can irradiate them we can throw toxic molecules on them and they become senescent and we can stain those cells blue as you can see the blue cells on this plate and then we can throw drugs in this plate of cells and in fact we can do this at a 384 wells on a single plate and we can do a number of different plates so we can screen a million drugs this way for things which might kill just the blue cells and we can then image it in a certain device we have in the lab and we can see changes in the size of the cells we also can see changes in number and we can see the loss of this blue staining and then this image is actually a fluorescent signal and by doing this we can identify drugs that specifically kill senescent cells the other way that we've done this is we've analyzed them molecularly for every change we can find and this shows different genes that are expressed in non-senescent cells versus senescence cells and we can see that they're dramatically different and by doing artificial intelligence analysis so a lot of computer analysis we can identify what are called nodes that are uh up regulated or increased in these cells and this has been used over the number of years to identify targets for cancer therapy because these nodes are upregulated and are thought to be things which protect the tumor cell from dying and we now think we can identify these nodes which are involved in protecting senescence cells from dawn and in fact that was one of the aha moments we've had over the last five years is comparing a senescent cell to a tumor cell they actually appear to be very similar so one of the things we've been able to do is take existing cancer drugs in this case called spray cell that's used for certain types of leukemias and lymphomas as well as certain types of solid tumors a natural product you can buy at the pharmacy or at the drugstore that has been shown that anti-cancer activity and then a new drug that's not yet clinically approved but it's been in clinical trials for certain types of cancers called nevadoclax and we've shown that if you add these drugs to a culture of senescent cells it will specifically kill those senescent cells and not the non-semester cells so unlike cancer where you have to treat the patient every day that the interesting thing about developing drugs that are called synalytics that kill these nested cells is we don't have to give them every day so the thought here is we could give it intermittently so once a month once every six months and what they would do is clear these senescent cells here shown in yellow so if you treat once a month or every six months you clear the senescence cells and then over time do the damage the cells come back and you treat again to clear the senescent cells and so using this approach we've been working in a number of different pre-clinical animal models and these are animal models of a variety of diseases of aging including alzheimer's pulmonary fibrosis osteoarthritis kidney disease and clearing these senescent cells has improved every one of these diseases as well as extended health span in animal models and there are currently 10 clinical trials ongoing at the mayo clinic and soon at the university of minnesota using these repurposed drugs to treat these diseases this isn't just something that's in the laboratory it's something which is now is used clinically and so i thought just before laura closes i just like to say one thing that's not on this list is actually viral infection so one of the things that's been observed is that with a coven 19 pandemic people over 65 are dying at a higher frequency and we now have data that suggests that if you clear these senescent cells at least from animal models that it reduces mortality in aged animals exposed to viral infection so we're starting a clinical trial to clear senescent cells to see if it reduces mortality following copennine infection so that is another application and laura referred to the metformin uh being used uh as a way of not only treating type 2 diabetes but seems to delay a number of other conditions there are studies being shown the metformin treatment actually is reducing mortality or at least hospitalization of people over 65 so it looks like metformin treatment may have a benefit too again consistent with the concept that what we want to target is aging and not specific diseases [Music]
