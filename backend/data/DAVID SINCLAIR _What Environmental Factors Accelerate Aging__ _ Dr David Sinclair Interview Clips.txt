[Music] so [Music] and that is that there are a number of ways to disrupt these loops and packages of our dna and the most effective way to do that if you want to age fast is to break your dna a broken chromosome is a disaster for a cell it'll die if it doesn't fix it and in the panic of trying to ligate and glue back the dna these loops and these structures these bound up loops they actually become unraveled which is a good thing initially but once you fix the chromosome and join the dna back together then you have to put it all package it back together the loops have to go back to being loops and the packages have to go back being packages if you don't do that over time as i mentioned it's like scratches on a record or scratches on a cd the cell can't read the right genes at the right time and cells lose their ability to function and that is aging do you think to some extent this device right here and our laptops and all this frequency that's coming at us and potentially 5g which has been banned in a couple of nations including israel do you think this is partly to blame for some of the information laws uh well i think that radiation in general is bad if it disrupts these loops and it's unclear nobody's ever studied uh that kind of thing so what i'd love to know is does 5g cause a cell to get older faster we can test that in my lab we could know it within a week well the reason that that my theory is is important here is that if you just think that aging is caused by um mutations leading or or if the only thing you're worried about is then you'll miss the effects on aging right so you know if you take um most radiation emitting devices whether it's a scanner at the airport or or an x-ray machine they'll test that on on animals and ask does it cause cancer yes or no and if it doesn't then it's all good right it's not cancer-causing but as my book explains that's only half of the problem that you need to look at the other half is aging can be accelerated and in my lab we've tested this idea we've deliberately cut chromosomes in a mouse and guess what happens to them they get old they get 50 older than their brothers and sisters so broken chromosomes and disrupting these loops definitely causes acceleration of the aging clock and we need to look harder at whether devices that emit radiation can accelerate aging and nobody's looking well i'm pretty nervous about x-rays i know they're important but sometimes they're used over zealously for example i think my dentist overuses x-rays and i'm not sure if it's to pay for the machine they bought or what but i tried to refuse to get an x-ray because i know what x-rays do to aging it's clear to me that they accelerate the clock and when i refused they said no you have to do it there's no question i was forced into getting an x-ray over my own will and i talk about this in the book that um as much as we need and love the medical community there are some practices that need to be revised and re-examined so x-rays is one and i think for women especially with the mammograms that's a big one are there other areas in the medical field that that worry you that actually create aging like what about meds what about all the pharmaceutical drugs right well these drugs are typically used to save people's lives the one that i'm going to mention would be doxorubicin a lot of the the cancer treatments the chemotherapies uh are intentionally damaging dna and breaking chromosomes in their effort to selectively kill the cancer cells which divide very quickly and are susceptible to these drugs but we now know that that accelerates aging in the rest of the body the same way these mice that i mentioned we can damage their chromosomes and accelerate aging the same happens to patients that get chemotherapy now that's important because you know if without chemotherapy you might die so it's it's a life-saving treatment but the side effect is pretty horrible too it increases the chance of future cancers and it leads to accelerated aging so i would love to be able to find ways to prevent and treat cancer without damaging the dna and so there are some new new avenues so immunotherapy seems to be promising so that could be um an area that hopefully one day does away with what are fairly barbaric drugs [Music] foreign [Music]
