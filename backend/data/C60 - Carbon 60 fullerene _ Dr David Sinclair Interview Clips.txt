so [Music] so any thoughts on uh the impact of c60 fullerenes so i am i'm open to the possibility um i know the the lead author ayan um i've talked to him about it i'm currently interestingly no one knows this but i'm currently trying his product which has oleic acid fused to c60 and i'm gonna see if it helps or not if it doesn't i'll stop if it does i'll keep doing it um but the effects were dramatic there was a um i i think it was close to 30 40 lifespan extension it was crazy so i'm i'm open to oh you're 90 there you go that is truly insane if it's true um what's the mechanism well iron i think um it thinks that it's also mitochomesis in the same way exercise hyperbaric oxygen and metformin create a disruption in the electron transport chain that leads to free radicals that creates mito hormesis and you get health that way and uh he could be right about that i have i really don't know if that's true but that's his theory but i am just to give something that is useful more and more mechanism points to mitopromises as a productive way to boost longevity and that's why i'm bullish on exercise and metformin as ways to do that [Music] [Applause] [Music]
