[Music] so hi everyone it's so exciting to be here to see um this event that's being put on um it's such an exciting space um so for those of you that haven't met before I do see a couple of familiar faces my name is Dr Nicola Conan um and I am a Scientist and I specialize in the science of cellular aging so what is it that is going on inside of our cells to call the aging process that we see going on on the outside and um we've just spoken a lot of about drugs in that uh previous presentation and my background is actually in drug development um so I was very fortunate enough to work for some companies that were very forward thinking that started looking at developing drugs to slow aging nearly a decade ago now so um yeah but actually I am not in the drug development industry anymore I actually left in 2017 and I founded my own company which is is called Nido Laboratories um and that was for one major reason and that I could see that there was all this fantastic science happening around the space of longevity um and actually many of the molecules that we were researching that seemed to work really well when it came to cellular aging were not your classic drug molecules they were not molecules that um drugs companies could patent and own and therefore they weren't getting the research that I felt that they deserved they were more natural molecules so I set up um Nido labor and um our mission was basically let's take some of these molecules that aren't your typical drug molecules give them the research that they deserve and basically try to get some of this science into the hands of people and consumers much quicker so our mission is basic basically to translate the latest science in the field of Aging into consumer products that people can actually start benefiting from now um until we are you know in the future in the in a position where we will have such drugs that have just been spoken about so I think um everyone here knows that it's just such an exciting time to be involved in anything to do with aging and Longevity it seems now that a day doesn't go by um where we don't have some big headline or some new paper being published um to show us that we really can slow aging on a cellular level and actually a lot more evidence now that we can even reverse some of the the signs of cellular aging so it's just incredibly exciting to be involved in this space so when we founded the company um NAD was one of the things we wanted to focus on because we could see that a lot of the the products and things that were out there were not really making sense when you looked at the science um so basically we designed a a different supplement that works entirely differently um and what we were looking to do is basically address all of these root causes of NAD decline so we wanted to switch back on that nppt enzyme so that Salvage pathway was working better again we wanted to inhibit that inflammatory cd38 so that wasn't um unnecessarily waste in NAD and also promote recycling rather than excretion of the nicotinamide um and wasting these methyl groups so um as I mentioned my background is in drug development and everyone thought I was a little bit crazy when I left that very reputable job to have a supplement company but my vision was that we wanted to bring out things that actually have some good clinical testing and science behind them so we did a clinical trial so this was a double Blinder Placebo control crossover study so you know a gold standard in terms of design it was 28 people um our participants were actually aged between 20 to 80 and there were also male and female which is very unusual for a clinical study all the studies for NAD have been done in sort of 55 to 65 year old men which I'm pretty sure you'll agree is not very representative um so we did it a bit differently so so what did we actually look at well first of all we wanted to check NAD so um it it boosts NAD so that was that was good um we also wanted to look at how quickly it boosts NAD is this you know how soon are we seeing the effects and we saw a significant increase in NAD in the blood after just s days the key thing for us was though yes we're boosting NAD but are we actually fixing a root cause of NAD decline are we actually switching back on the nppt enzyme that is so crucial for NAD production in our cells and you can see here that compared to Placebo we are actually increasing levels of the enzyme in the cells of these participants and this is the first human study to actually demonstrate that a a supplement can actually fix a root cause of NAD decline we also looked at levels of the searchin these um you know these longevity proteins that are very critical for switching on a lot of cellular Health Pathways and saw an increased level of those as well and also what we wanted to do is check that we weren't driving inflammation was this NAD go into beneficial Pathways and not to cd38 because one of the components of the supplement is a cd38 inhibitor and you can see that we did actually significantly reduce um some inflammatory cyto kindes so for us again that shows that it is actually helping to fix some of the root causes of this decline we also look at glycation glycation is um an important um factor in aging it's where sugar molecules become irreversibly bind to proteins it's a huge problem in things like skin aging um and also stiffening of the arteries and again we can see that that actually went down as well so that was good but I guess most exciting for me um was that we actually saw a reduction in biological age and I don't need to explain this because Nina's already done it and we used the gon age kit and saw that in just 28 days we saw on average a reduction in biological age by 1.26 years so again it's showing that this um the increase in NAD that we're seeing is actually going to improving the health of our body and our cells so just to finish off you know people say well it's fair enough measuring all these biomarkers and things like that but the top question I always get asked is how does this relate to something clinical so we do want to do more clinical studies in the future but just some feedback from customers in that the top reported things that we see are first of all an improvement in physical energy and also cognitive function so mental energy and again this makes perfect sense because NAD is so critical for energy production the other thing that we see is um a huge um benefit in people's sleep and one thing that's not talked about very much is the fact that NAD is very important in regulating Cadian Rhythm um and it a decrease in NAD can cause this some problems in this as you get older um and then yeah with continued use you see the the improvements in the outside like your hair skin and Nails I generally don't get as excited about them but lots of people do and you know if your cells are in good health on the inside then that is also going to show on the outside so thank you so much a
