[Music] it's going to be radically different right now there are two problems one is that there's a the wrong mindset as i mentioned a lot of doctors most doctors will treat diseases often when it's too late and with the wrong mindset uh doctors are not inclined to try and prevent you from getting aging the second is that we don't have a lot of technology right now even if doctors wanted to slow aging they only have a couple of things they can do and they can advise to eat less often and do exercise but in the future 10 15 years from now doctors will have uh the knowledge and the tools to be able to give a 40 50 year old a weekly or even a daily medicine that would delay the aging process so that you don't get cancer in your 70s you don't have a heart attack in your 80s or dementia in your 90s and if you don't get sick you live longer so this is the the approach to medicine of the future you know it's very similar to 100 years ago where you know we didn't understand cancer we didn't understand infection very well and doctors would say okay there's not much we can do we can cut it out we can cut off a limb but you know go home and get your things in order once we understood that it's bacteria you can kill and that you can actually treat cancer with medicines we started to treat these really like things that are not necessarily a death sentence and aging is like that we're slowly understanding that we can push it further out and we can actually do something about it [Music] [Applause] you
