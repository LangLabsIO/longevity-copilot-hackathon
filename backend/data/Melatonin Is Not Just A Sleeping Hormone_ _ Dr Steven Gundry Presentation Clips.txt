[Music] well we've known for a number of years that uh shift workers people who work night shifts and evening shifts have far greater rates of chronic disease whether it's diabetes whether it's cancer and we've known that this is partially because of a circadian rhythm problem that we're supposed to be awake during sunlight we're supposed to be asleep during darkness we now know that there are only two actual antioxidants in mitochondria that have any effect and one of them is melatonin the second is glutathione so we're now learning that melatonin is actually a major mitochondrial repair hormone and rather than think of melatonin as a sleep hormone because melatonin comes out at night when you go to sleep we should be thinking of melatonin as a repair hormone that's produced during sleep because that's when mitochondria should be actually quieting down and going through reparation and repair functions and there's some very fascinating evidence that one of the reasons people who are deficient in melatonin or have poor sleep or who are shift workers have much more incidence of cancer is that melatonin is very suppressive of cancer growth in fact some fascinating evidence that cancer cells grow during the daylight and stop growing at night and we think it's because of the presence of melatonin at night and i i talk about some of my patients and my dog who i give remarkably high dose melatonin for what was inoperable bladder cancer and a year and a half later she's doing great so um yeah and i also put put her on some uncouplers so yeah melatonin is also present in food and for instance pistachios are the highest containing food and melatonin huge amounts of melatonin and pistachios they're also present mushrooms they're present in coffee and tea they're present in wine they're present in olive oil and one of the theories that i talk about in the book is that maybe the mediterranean diet is so good because of all the melatonin containing foods in the mediterranean diet rather than anything else something to think about [Music] you
