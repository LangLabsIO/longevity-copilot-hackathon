[Music] i'd like to be controversial to get people to think and i've said that it's possible that the first person to live to 150 has already been born but for those of us who were born in the 20th century um i think it's reasonable to expect that we could make it to 100 or more if you just know the fact that if you do the right things that we all know don't smoke eat less or certainly don't don't become obese do some exercise eat less often eat the right foods and get sleep and don't stress have some friends around that gives you 14 years of extra life compared to someone who doesn't do those things if you add on the things we now know which is how to intermittent fast some supplements that may work some exercise programs that are optimal uh i don't and future discoveries of course we you know we've got another 20 30 years to go that these can really help including age reversal then i think we could easily make it to 100 um can we make it 120 and beyond i'm much more optimistic now than i was even five years ago given a that you can reverse the age of a tissue and b the amount of interest that's piling on into the aging field including investment in biotechnology companies that will develop medicines that i'm certain we'll see in our lifetime the easy things are skip a meal each day two if you can move but yes get off your chair uh run 10 minutes every few at least 10 minutes a few times a week lift weights or do yoga uh try meditation try to sleep well don't over eat i need the right foods um the right foods for total longevity are uh mostly bent towards uh vegetables uh but meat's not gonna kill you you know i'm not one of these uh strict vegetarians in my own life either um so all of that is the start that that's easy and and but unfortunately the government's been telling us that for probably the last 30 years and it hasn't penetrated the entire population um there are alternatives there are drugs that are on the market that are thought to extend lifespan and slow down aging one of them that i think is the most promising is metformin a drug that's given to type 2 diabetics that have high blood sugar and it's a it's a relatively safe drug it's on the list of the world health organizations essential medicines for humanity uh it's actually just bought like candy at in other countries besides the us it's over the counter but here in the us you need a prescription so the government if they could fund at least a study to sh to test maybe not show the test that metformin can slow down diseases it would be great right now we have a lot of circumstantial evidence from papers published that have looked at over 40 000 type 2 diabetics and they on average live longer than non-diabetics they have less cancer heart disease alzheimer's frailty so it looks really good and for just a few cents a day which would be one of these pills i calculated with my colleagues and published just yesterday in the journal nature aging that in the us alone in the long run you could save about 86 trillion dollars and that's conservative that just says that we could live an extra 2.6 years if we could go 10 years we're talking about 300 or more trillion dollars savings to the us economy in the long run [Music] you
