[Music] i really like thinking about in addition to um that wonderful very comprehensive sort of definition um i like thinking about the evolution of it as well and um i know a mutual friend of ours dr mark matson who is a great neuroscientist um used to be at the nih and now he's we're he's an adjunct professor where jed current formerly was at um johns hopkins and he he to some degree um i'm referring to him because i i've read a lot of his you know papers and i recently interviewed him on my podcast a couple of months ago and he talks about a lot of these phytochemicals in an interesting way some certainly like not all of them but like some of them as these plant insecticides so these plants have evolved a way to produce chemicals that can keep insects away and from eating them and destroying them and um so a lot of these phytochemicals are or plant insecticides in some cases will affect the nervous system of insects they'll kind of make them a little like you know wonky so they can't figure out to go bite the leaf you know and so um humans have have evolved ways to to basically ward off the potential toxicity of any of these insecticides by activating a variety of genetic pathways um you know to to you know get rid of you know the the the toxic potentially toxic plant and sex insecticide and to activate you know a variety of anti-inflammatory pathways and antioxidant pathways and the pathways that are activated to detoxify in some cases um some of these plant phytochemicals have a variety of benefits that come along with that so um as as the expert dr jed fahey knows one of those pathways would be the the nrf2 pathway and so um i really i really like thinking about those phytochemicals in that way because we've we've evolved this genetic way to to it's like we were meant to eat these phytochemicals we were meant to eat these plants and they do amazing things when we eat them they're changing our genes the way our genes are activated and they're doing enormously beneficial things by doing that so um like that's to me is so fascinating that you know we're we're we've evolved these mechanisms to to basically not only handle the tiny tiny tiny little bit of stress from these phytochemicals but we have a net positive effect by activating these robust antioxidant anti-inflammatory pathways and these detoxification pathways and um so so to me that's like one of the coolest parts of it right about these vital chemicals they all often think about it as antioxidant itself like you're getting vitamin c or alpha tocopherol one of the major forms of vitamin e and it's just not the same at all so i did my postdoc with dr bruce ames and at the time when i joined his lab they were doing research on something that they called the cory bar at the time and it was a it was a bar that mark shigenaga um a a good friend of mine who's just brilliant gut researcher and um bruce and a few others joyce mccann had come up with a way to get a broad range of micronutrients so we're talking vitamin d fat soluble ones like vitamin d omega-3 fatty acids they have dha in there they had you know magnesium b vitamins you know just just like a panel of like the classical micronutrients that a maturity of the u.s population is got insufficient levels of but they also added some phytochemicals they had some some of these polyphenols from chocolate and some other phytochemicals in there but with mark's you know insight he said well we need if we need something that's like a food matrix we need something that's like a food matrix that can mimic like what what a plant would do if it had all these micronutrients and phytochemicals there and so he he came up with certain types of fiber hpmc is one and and they so they clinical studies done on this bar fast forward they were trying to do a deconstruction trial to figure out okay what happens if you give people the cory bar this this micronutrient bar with just the micronutrients or just the the phytochemicals or without the fiber matrix and with the given the fiber matrix without the chemical phytochemicals and micronutrients and what they found was that you needed the whole package the benefits that were found with some of the biomarkers of lowering inflammation increasing hdl lowering some of the bad parts of ldl small dense ldl those didn't happen when you did just one or the other you took away the micronutrients and the phytochemicals and everything needed the food matrix there and i that was just a great study because it really does drive home that concept of you know this food matrix this fiber matrix where you get all these micronutrients is important it's important very important and so um there's like you said there's synergy going on there's additive effects there's things that we don't understand we don't know why but it seems to be important to have the whole package [Music] you
