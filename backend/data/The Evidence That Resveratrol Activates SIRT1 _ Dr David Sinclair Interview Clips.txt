[Music] um there was a debate let's call it about how these activators work based on an assay that was in vitro we've done a lot of work on this now we've published now an evidence for for how these actually work and you can see here that there's an activation domain in the n-terminus there that blue thing and if we mutate an amino acid in that in that hinge region we don't get the activation anymore um you can see there resveratrol and this 1720 and 2104 that went into humans they look very different than each other and these were the ones on the right the srt 2104 and srt 1720 were about a thousand times more potent than resveratrol you can see there's about 18 to 20 crystal structures up there so we can now block this motion as a geneticist we can just create cells and a mouse that doesn't do this activation step and ask the really important question in a cell or in an animal does resveratrol work through this activation step or is it working through empty kinase or one of the other dozen mechanisms that resveratrol is thought to work through um there was some positive results that was going very well uh around 2014 2015 this was some early signs in 40 patients that 2104 when it got on board the patients was quite effective it's published in 2015 but now let's look at those mice that are mutant for that one amino acid insert one um they actually have absolutely no response to resveratrol in an assay for a variety of things this one i'm showing you is lifespan on a high fat diet where you want to compare the green line to the red line um so you know i'm happy to debate it but i think this is pretty much proof that the resveratrol activates one and provides longevity on a high fat diet through this mechanism the other thing that's interesting about this is that the mutant has a phenotype which either suggests that we naturally get these activators from our diet and we've evolved to sense the plant world an idea that we've proposed with conrad howitz but also maybe there's an endogenous activator of sirtuins that would explain why this same amino acid is conserved and probably this mechanism in worms flies and clearly mice [Music] foreign
