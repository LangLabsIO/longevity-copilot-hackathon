so so [Music] um you talked about these yamanaka factors these four genes that he won the nobel prize and you've taken three of those genes and identified that these three can in this case repair a nerve an optic nerve which is fascinating to the idea that maybe we can help you know people see again or use it for other nerve related diseases so my question is two things one why those three how did you decide that the fourth one didn't make sense and two you said you're delivering these genes by a virus well today we're all surrounded in this world where virus is bad but you're using it for good so can you explain a little bit about that yeah sure three the four genes um so the mick the m one at the end uh it's been known for 50 years to be a cancer-causing gene so it didn't take a genius to leave it out but the question was would it still work and would it be safe to put in three embryonic genes and that that's part of the revelation that we we've come to which is that it's it you don't need that mick for it to work in fact it works better without it for age reversal and i think that's in part because you don't want to push the system too far right you just want to push it back halfway go too far it could be bad and so without the mick it goes back to being young but there's a barrier it doesn't seem to go further unless you put mick in so we've locked out there so we left off mick and then when we put it into mice not just the eye but the whole body we've now put yeah um this virus into uh we see for a year of turning these genes on there's no downside we see a trend towards even less cancer and we're looking forward over the next five years or so to test what these genes are capable of and the virus issue so right now there are fda approved viruses that are domesticated the ones that are approved are called aav which means adeno associated viruses and they're very safe for use in humans they're not uh dangerous and you know they've had all the bad genes taken out of them but they do infect nerve cells and other cells in the body and so for instance a company called spark therapeutic some people may have heard of spark they were the first to get a fda approval to use aav delivery of genes to restore vision in the optic nerve and we're just riding on their coattails standing on their shoulders using those same technologies that are already fda approved to deliver the genes but ultimately we don't want to just have to use gene therapy my colleagues and i including the belmonte lab that i mentioned at salk institute we're rushing as fast as we can to find simpler ways to reprogram the body so that it could be a pill could be a cream we don't know but we think that uh the sky is the limit and it could become you know just a simple pill that you take after 50 that keeps you younger for longer so would that pill be like the proteins that the genes might normally be expressing or producing good question so the big question that i want to solve or hopefully someone else can solve but we need to figure this out for humanity is how does the cell know what was 50 years ago in humans or in a mouse two years ago there's a storage of information there that we don't fully understand we call it the observer which is an old-fashioned term for a backup hard drive of the system but it exists we know how to tap it in tap into it but we don't know where that is now we do know some of the clock work we do know that when these genes are switched on these three genes you need enzymes that remove those chemicals the methyls dna methylation because when we delete those uh or knock them down in the eye you don't restore vision so we're starting to see how this thing works but we have a lot more work to figure out the whole system right now you know it's more like magic you throw them in and it works but i think very soon in the future i think a lot of people are going to try to figure this out and when we get an idea of how it's possible that the cell knows that these 50 000 should be tweaked up and then these other thousands go down don't touch these other ones once we understand that and who's involved then we'll have a much easier time of making medicines that can do this instead of gene therapy and the other thing i thought was really interesting is that you were using an antibiotic to activate the virus again one of those things that people don't think go together antibiotics have nothing to do with viruses they're about bacteria how does it activate the virus yeah well in biology these days you can do anything right and you're only limited by your imagination we do experiments in my lab that would have cost a billion dollars and a student can do it in a couple of days now 400 bucks so as you know mark and most people uh who are paying attention to genetics it's it's a it's a golden era and so what we've engineered for the first time is a highly regulatable system so we can turn on these genes at will just by feeding the mouse or in the case of clinical trials in humans we should be able to give an antibiotic the antibiotic is doxycycline which you can take for a whole variety of reasons if you go to africa and you don't want to catch diseases you can take that so it's very safe but we don't use it to kill off bacteria it's designed to turn on these genes and and the good thing about it is the way we're planning and i haven't told you this but let me tell you we're planning in less than two years to start the first clinical trial in glaucoma which most people will know is pressure-induced damage to the retina our plan is to deliver those genes to the eye prescribe a course three-week course of antibiotics which will turn on the genes you hopefully will get your vision back in the case of the mice they get their vision back and then you stop taking the antibody and it should stay that way you've reset the age of the cells now you'll still age back again but we don't know how many times you can reset we've done it once yeah interesting if you can do it a hundred times why glaucoma obviously you know i'm fascinated by this particular research of yours because i don't think there's been a lot of people that have been able to regenerate the nerve you know quite this way so could you see it used for paralysis and other nerve types of damage or you know other things in the brain or whatnot why'd you choose this and how likely do you think it is to relate to other nerve issues oh i'd be very surprised if it didn't work generally across the body and in in human neurons generally we've we've tested it in human neurons um it also prevents them from dying when damaged by a chemotherapeutic drug we get the growth i showed you those plates i didn't have time that we can get them to regrow as though they were young again and those are human cells right this isn't mouse so i think it's generalizable i could be wrong of course but but if i was to be a betting man i would say it's a good chance that we will be able to reset uh any aspect of the central nervous system or peripheral nervous system um and one of the reasons for that is that we didn't choose the eye for any good reason other than it was a good model for the central nervous system and others have done the kidney and the skin which are very different systems i think this is a very fundamental cause of aging that as i mentioned is found in things like baker's yeast all the way through humans and we're tapping into something that is old as life itself [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] you
