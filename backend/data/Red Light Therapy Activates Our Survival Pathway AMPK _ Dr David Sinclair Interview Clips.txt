[Music] uh it brought a smile to my face when i was reading the science on the red light therapy and the hyperbaric oxygen so they all point to mitochondria again even the red light there are scientific papers that i could pull out that show that the red light at that at that wavelength is disrupting the ability of mitochondria to make energy um the way mitochondria make energy is that it's like a hot potato they take electrons and they pass them along red light disrupts that and then you have low energy and your ampk system detects low energy and starts to give you the health benefits because it's worried that you're going to run out of energy so light oxygen hunger simulating low energy or in some cases actually is low energy and it's been shown to protect against hair loss and improve skin uh and stimulating stem cells i tried shining some red light on some nematode worms to make them live longer it didn't work that was a few years ago um i think there's a lot more data now that it's it's likely to be working similar to exercise and fasting but through a light mechanism which is actually easier [Applause] [Music] [Applause] you
