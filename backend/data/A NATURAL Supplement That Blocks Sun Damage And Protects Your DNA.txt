[Music] oxidative damage is hugely important as you get older in our mitochondria we use oxygen because we have to uh 1 to 7% roughly um be develops into what we call free radicals free radicals destroy cells they destroy DNA proteins and lipids especially bad in your brain because lipid peroxidation will cause significant brain damage so we need something uh that squelches basically all of the free radicals asanin is a absolutely natural substance it comes from algae that gets pissed off as my kids say is that the angry algae one I'm like yes yes it is so when algae gets mad uh why does it m get mad oxidate or uh something in the environment stresses it out be it temperature nutrient depletion whatever have you uh it creates this orange pinkish goo and that is aanin and it's in all of the Marine systems so it's in Salmon it's in um like this uh the beaks of um of those pink birds ibises it's in Quail eyes anything that's pink is is asto anthon um anyway so there is absolutely no downside to taking ases anthon unless you have gout that's problem but anyone else can absolutely take aaz anthon and what's really cool about it is if you have very pale skin and you're in the sun it blocks sun damage live on myami beach um we have a lot of sun um I'm clearly translucent both of my daughters are very pale especially my red head she doesn't do it as much as she used to but she used to be outside all the time playing competitive tennis and when she didn't take her ASA anthon it was a disaster so it basically it gets into your system um so there's adents and there's supplements just as a yet another tangent if you take something and your body already has it it's a supplement and the reason that that's important is your body has a way to get rid of it faster right Adu vents don't necessarily they have to go by the standard process of of sort of being being gotten rid of Asos anthon has a very long halflife when you take it it goes out to your mitochondria and it it quales free radicals and it also quales free radicals that derive from the sun right the sun actually creates free radicals that destroys your DNA uh it causes inflammatory um uh issues in your cells it also melts your DNA together into CP diers which you're bad which you can actually fix with something else but again that's a tangent um anyway it gets into the membranes of your mitochondria it sits there it sucks up free radicals and then you excrete it 24 hours later has absolutely no side effects which is amazing um and it just blocks the inflammatory response which means it blocks the sun damage and protects your DNA um most people like the the low dose is four milligrams you can take up to eight 16 there's really no limit I started recently taking a liposomal I think it's I want to say it's 24 milligram and I've had no side effects because there aren't any um if you're a teenager and you're like you know 70 some kilos I would go with eight um if you're out in the sun all the time if you're a runner if you have an outdoor job um then then you can go with more you know 12 is fine I just know that my myself and my two kids are going to be taking it every day for like a 100 years so I buy it in massive bulk and of course that reduces the price [Music] n
