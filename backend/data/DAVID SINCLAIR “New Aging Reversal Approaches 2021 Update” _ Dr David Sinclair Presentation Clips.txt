[Music] so [Music] so one of the theories that we've had in my lab actually since i was a post-doc at mit is the idea that the epi genome is important for aging um and it's it all started with the discovery of sertuan genes um as a regulator of yeast aging with brian kennedy and lenny guaranty's work in the lab that i was in um and if you don't know sir tuan uh where the name comes from is a yeast gene called cer2 sir2 and the i stands for information and so sirtuins are epigenetic regulators and the question was what the heck is an epigenetic regulator gene silence or doing extending life span in yeast and it turns out that these genes these these enzymes which are diastolases do a couple of major things in the cell um and many others but the two major things they do is they control gene expression and maintain youthful gene expression in yeast and in mammals but they also are important at least three of them in nucleus for dna repair and especially double strand dna breaks and so we published this work now a number of years ago the east in 1999 in mammals 2008 where we said that perhaps one of the drivers of epigenomic noise which we believe is a major contributor to the aging process um maybe those are uh double strand breaks are actually a major driver of that process and you can see in this uh summary that was uh jan vice companion to our cell paper shows that uh in this case cert one but we also know cert seven and so t6 are distracted by double strand breaks they move to the break they help repair and then somehow they have to find their way back to where they came from to reestablish gene expression as it was before but this doesn't happen efficiently or 100 and what we find is that if we do this in yeast cells uh and as i'll show you in mammals you get uh epigenomic drift or also known as epigenomic noise which we believe is a a result of cells being co-regulating gene expression with dna repair and if you know antagonistic pleiotropy this predicts that what's good for you when you're young ends up being bad for you when you get old um and so one of the one of the two questions that we have is if you create this process in a mammal does it accelerate aging that we we predict that it should and then if you reverse the process you should get younger and organs and tissues should function like they're young again because their gene expression will be reset to a young state uh so we built this uh system in cells and in mice and we've done this a lot over the last 10 years i'll be just summarizing it we have a system called the eye system it's inducible changes to the epigenome and what we find when we induce double-stranded breaks that are not mutagenic they just alter the epigenome we we've now gone in and looked at this in three and four dimensions and what i can tell you is that double-stranded breaks even if they're repaired perfectly they do alter chromatin um in places that are very far away from the actual cut uh the changes are heritable in cells um we don't know about between uh generations yet uh interestingly embryonic genes and particularly developmental genes are hot spots for these epigenetic changes and this is just one example from the manuscript that we're in the process of revising you can look at it on bioarchives if you're keen and this was work done in collaboration with dovetail genomics and the hox locus you'll recall is the locus that consists of at least 13 genes here that control our head from our tail during development and during aging the contacts between these various genes and uh regions oh is altered the what you want to see is that the cree is the control that was not cut and we cut this for 24 hours and let the cells recover and then the eye cells that were treated they lose a lot of these contacts and in response you get changes in histone modifications um as well as gene expression so that's one thing that i want to drive home which is that if you um go and have an x-ray or you have a ct scan your cells will have a memory of that event epigenetically and gene expression will not be the same and we think that this is a driver of aging and in fact the epigenetic clock in these cells is advanced based on dna methylation so the mouse uh some of you have seen this mouse but it's just it's worth mentioning again how striking this is if we do three weeks of this treatment in an animal across all tissues and we do this in a way that doesn't cause mutations it doesn't even cause any illness in these mice if we wait 10 months that's the untreated control at 16 months of age and this is the treated one and these are epigenetically old uh we can measure that i'll show you how we measure clocks in my lab now we have a new method uh but this was done in collaboration with a number of labs um vadim's lab as well as zymo but not just the clock is advanced these mice actually are old they're physiologically old gene expression is old histologically they're old um and we can dial aging up as fast as we want we can make this mouse get old in two months or 10 months or or 13 months because it's inducible doxx tamoxifen inducible importantly there's no increase in mutation so what this is arguing is first of all this is a this is a hail mary experiment right it didn't have to work this way these mice could have died they could have gotten cancer they didn't they got aging and so this is aging in the absence of mutations doesn't mean mutations aren't important of course you know yarns works very important but it does show that you don't need mutations to change the age of an animal and this mouse on the right on these mice which we've looked at hundreds probably a thousand or more now are about 150 percent the age of the controls um so we we've realized i think all of us that dna methylation clocks are a little expensive if you want to test a million people and not very high throughput um for instance illumina dna microarray unless you get a super deal uh of you know super bulk you're still going to pay 150 to three hundred dollars per sample uh and then you have to do our rbs and that's in 250 500 per sample so that that gives you across the genome but it's still uh fairly fairly expensive um if you do it in populations uh so patrick griffin who's a talented graduate student in the lab decided to figure out a way to do this faster and cheaper and he's come up with what he calls time seek tegmentation-based indexing for methylation sequencing and basically what it's using is a transposon tn5 to insert barcodes into sites that we want to sequence for dna methylation and so he uses that method it works really well you can then pull multiple samples of mouse dna or human dna doesn't matter and you can pull 96 you can you can pull a lot together and then that immediately reduces the cost uh because you run them all in one sequencing run uh and then we also do an enrichment step as well which is uh helpful to reduce the cost so to give you an idea of how far this has come over the last few years um when we sequence the pools and then deconvolute the samples there we get beautiful data coming out that's an example of the primary data we can look at particular cpgs we can look at thousands of them at once uh this is a mouse clock that um the mouse data is really really quite beautiful it's come out you can see how well this works and for this uh current technology we're less than ten dollars for a sample uh patrick can process 600 in a couple of days it's not a big deal anymore and it'll just get cheaper and faster from here on um we teamed up with alex who you heard earlier uh and vadim and we were amazed to see that even with shallow sequencing we could get high levels of significance and age prediction and the the data that comes out of this is spectacular better than we expected and in fact this is very cheap uh this is down as it says there to less than two dollars a sample which means that using this and getting it down even lower in price we can literally be doing millions of people every few months what about the age reprogramming so epigenetics is now very hard we published a paper in december shown down in the bottom right it's not impressed actually published we were looking for ways to reset the epigenome right we were driving it forwards for 10 years but we wanted is there a backup copy of the earlier epigenome and uh we were inspired by uh while juan carlos belmonte's work and alex ocampo who showed in a pro-droid model that four of the yamanaka factors when pulsed uh not continuous could instead of killing the mouse make them healthier and live longer it didn't mean that it was necessarily age reversal but we gave it a shot anyway uh the real breakthrough came when one changlu who's shown there uh left cemek out and found that it was just as effective at reversing aging without causing tumors or making any any kind of oncogenic signal and the age actually of the cells in the fibroblasts and the neurons that we've worked with goes back to a certain point let's say about 80 and then stops there's a barrier to going too young which you don't want to do you don't want to become a stem cell again and it's beautiful work also by xiao chan um and he came from vera gobanova's lab and so the system uh is three genes in a citron it's uh osk three of the yamanaka genes and we can turn this on and off with with tet and we know that this maintains the identity of mouse and human cells and resets the gene expression from an old to a young state takes just a matter of days in vitro and um weeks in vivo no induction of nanog or any sign of oncogenicity which is a blessing it's very safe if you deliver it into a mouse systemically through iv using an aav there was no adverse effects in fact the mice that we were forced to sac to publish that paper had a trend towards fewer fewer tumors not more um and so we chose the central nervous system to reprogram for a number of reasons um including it's a nice nice readout we know that old neurons don't regrow and young ones do but also we like the eye because that's a great place to start with human clinical trials because uh the fda has aavs approved for treatment of the eye and so we took mice this is uh in collaboration with the people on the bottom there gang her and benedict brahma did this original experiment where we we crushed the optic nerve to ask can you make it regrow which would be evidence that we could reverse aging and this is no treatment where most of the the optic nerve has died back towards the right where the brain is but if we turn on those yamanaka factors after the crush we can maintain the survival of most of those neurons and you can see that they even start to grow towards the brain and if we leave them longer instead of this is four weeks um of of induction we actually uh can now uh leave it for 16 weeks and see that most of these not most but many of the nerves make it back to the brain um so that was the beginning we've we've of course measured the age of these neurons um this is the and they are younger after the treatment this is a more of i think more impressive result looking at the the methylome and you can see what a difference it is between the middle column which is the untreated injured and then the treated injured on the right you can see how amazingly preserved the uh or reversed the dna methylation pattern is and i want to call out um steve horvath um and uh and also morgan levine was instrumental in this work uh we did glaucoma that worked we now have the ability to even better than we published uh on average make the glaucoma mice see again like they were uh young but the one that i like uh is the old mice so we took one year old black six mice which do not see and you can tell that because they don't follow a moving screen we treated them and the treatment is on the right here with this osk again i think you can appreciate the broad reversal of the dna methylation patterns how the cell knows which methylation patterns to restore is still unknown um methylation age was reduced as shown here uh what i think is even more striking is that the the gene expression patterns were restored not just which gene but by how much that gene should be restored uh and that's represented because these um rna-seq results are along this diagonal up to the left and that's an extremely significant result this is the improvement in vision after the treatment in the red versus blue um and one thing that we didn't expect is that when we compared the injured neurons in the first experiment versus aging there's an extremely high correlation you can see the p-value there is more atoms than the universe so what this tells us is very likely that injury cellular injury also accelerates aging in the same way that uh that normal aging does okay where are we going with this well this is work uh by xiao chan and and this is uh these are brain organized by jhoon young in the lab postdocs and we're now working with human tissue we've reprogrammed ipfcs that have the ice system and the osk reversal system in them uh these have brain activity they grow nicely they're a mix of cells of neurons and astrocytes and microglia they're also genetically different there are wild type human samples and apoe from patients that developed alzheimer's disease and our goal is to be testing genetic and chemical modifiers to reverse the the aging process and see if that will cure alzheimer's disease one of the nice things about this system is that most brain organoids are young because they come from ipscs but we can rapidly we think age them by using this ice system that i showed you in those mice and so what i've said is that we think that a large part of aging is epigenetic noise um which can be driven by double strand breaks which we experience a billion times a day in our bodies or cellular injury there's probably other drivers as well but we know this for this reprogramming is possible in you can use osk there's probably other ways we'll figure out and we're working on that and i didn't tell you this but that reprogramming and the recovery of vision requires tet 1 and two which are dna d-methylases um and so the point is perhaps the the dna methylation pattern and represented by the clock isn't just simply a clock it's actually participating in aging and required for its reversal and we're excited about applying this to other tissues and organs we've got preliminary and exciting results in the whole brain driving aging forwards and backwards in living brain tissue in mice muscle skin and very very old skin cells and so it where we're going with this ultimately is we hope to be able to figure out a way in our lifetimes to reprogram our entire bodies to be young again and hopefully reset multiple times um i think you all know me uh i don't just sit on publications we spun out a paper not a paper a company in 2017. this uh is called life biosciences um collaborators and co-founders in include um horvath serrano and belmonte and this platform has three technologies well this company has three platform technologies which are listed here i've talked a bit about the epigenetic reprogramming so that they're headed into primate studies this year and hopefully a year later ind submission for human blindness uh treatment whether it be glaucoma or other uh rare diseases the other platforms are mitochondrial uncoupling which is a a wonderful weight loss medicine which is also actually further advanced towards uh drug development that is uh a set of chemicals that uncouples mitochondria in a safe way we know that if you do it if you overdo it it can be unsafe but these molecules have a fail-safe mechanism that prevents any overdosing by anyone who wants to rapidly lose weight um and so i'm hoping that that'll be a treatment um and a solution to the world's obesity problem but also these molecules also mimic fasting in animals as well so that's the reason that i'm excited about them from an aging perspective um and then anne maria cuovo in her labs and everest her wonderful collaborator who does the chemistry are down at albert einstein college of medicine and they are working hard on um debaters of chaperone mediated autophagy to mimic fasting deep fasting like three days of fasting and anime has published a nature in a cell paper this year um and it's pretty exciting that that's also uh rapidly moving towards human uh clinical trials i want to thank the people that did the work on the left are my lab members party epigenetics team one change was the first author of the niche paper also greatly helped by many of the people listed uh and those underlying did the majority of the work collaborators the cassandra lab vadim's lab uh morgan steve gigan here and george church and noah helped us a lot with the viruses and many of other people along the way and thanks to the people that funded it to make it possible [Music] you
