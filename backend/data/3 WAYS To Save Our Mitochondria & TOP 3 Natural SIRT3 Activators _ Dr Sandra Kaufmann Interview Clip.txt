[Music] the sirtoons are they remove acetyl groups used to be just from histones but it turns out it's from all proteins and by removing acetyl groups it turns proteins on and we know of a minimum of 84 different mitochondrial proteins that gets activated with sir two and three and it has complex interactions with pgc1 Alpha and the amp kinase system but in general if you don't turn on your sirtuins you're losing at least 10 percent of your mitochondrial function if not more um and your sirtuins your two and three especially is the only one that's truly Associated or known to be associated with uh increasing Longevity if you activate it so that's important we also know it starts to decline in your 30s and it's abysmally low by the time you are 60 which means that all of your tissues that require a lot of energy are failing so your liver your brain your heart and your muscle are especially problematic right so if you activate your sirtuins this is the master regulator this is the first step right so there's probably about seven or eight known uh Naturals or two and three activators but a lot of them have only been studied in cell systems and the only big three that we've known that are in mammal systems are hinocchio which come from Magnolia um my second favorite is something called dihydramoricin and this one's actually incredibly interesting because someone noticed that it improved Liver Health right and someone else noticed that if you're hungover and you take the stuff you do better so it's actually marketed for hangover mornings and the reason that works is because if you're an alcoholic or if you drink a lot you're killing your mitochondria in your liver and by turning on the mitochondria in your liver you're going to recover faster so I felt kind of dumb ordering stuff for liver failure for my alcoholic problem which I don't have but I take it now daily because I think it's incredibly useful um but the third one that's really shocking that really helps with sir two and three is melatonin um which is actually is really interesting because it's been it's it's evolved with your mitochondria for like you know hundreds of thousands of years and it's been demonstrated that it too activates or two and three and quite a very substantial way so those are my top three right um one or all of them you know take your pick one's probably fine um the other problem with sir twins of course is we know that they require NAD as a cofactor it's coenzyme right so if you are not on NAD you're you're uh certain activation just isn't going to work so item two in saving your mitochondria has to be some sort of NAD precursor that's number two right and then the question is what comes next in saving your mitochondria and this is a toss-up um you want to activate your Nrf2 system which turns on all of your antioxidants you want to block the opening of your mitochondrial transition pore they're just many many things that you could possibly substitute in for number three um but because it's my absolute favorite nutrient I'm going to throw on astaxanthin because it is the best free radical scavenger that there is uh and it also increases your endogenous antioxidants your cabinets Etc so I would have to go with those three is my top choices foreign [Music] foreign [Music]
