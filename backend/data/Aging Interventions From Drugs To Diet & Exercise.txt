[Music] foreign [Music] but let me start with just the the bigger picture of Aging so aging is you know clearly something that we easily recognize but actually find hard to Define um in in terms of molecular processes physiologic processes I mean basically what we know what we would all say is there's some element of decline in structure and function that is the prototypic characteristic of Aging um so even though we we can't Define it so well we certainly are interested to find out if there's anything that we can do about it um so I'll talk a little bit about kind of interventions that are very high level that have become of interest in the fields of aging and gr science and are clearly of interest to the general public in terms of what we can do to potentially slow arrest and maybe even reverse aspects of aging and this ranges from things like drugs to diet and obviously to exercise um so let me just begin with with a couple of famous drugs that you've probably heard of that have been studied in this context and and one is of course the drug metformin and and many of you will have heard of this it's a very common diabetes drug and it's from a class of compounds that were originally found in the French lilac and used really in in folk medicine for for several centuries um and it's quite effective in in treating diabetes in studies of the the pathways that are affected by this drug there became an interest in how this kind of generally shifts metabolism and investigators began to look at this in terms of how it affected Aging in the kinds of animals that we study in the Aging field which include worms and flies and and mice and so forth and it was found that that treating these animals with metformin could actually extend their lifespan and that became kind of almost you know this kind of prototype of asking if it extends lifespan might it actually extend health spin in humans is where the field has evolved but a lot of this has really evolved around looking at lifespan extension but there's a key paper that was published now many years ago um quite a few years ago from the UK looking at the effects of metformin on survival in in humans and these are what I call what you see below here is what called a kind of survival curve or Kaplan Meyer curve where you start off with a group of people all of them are alive and then you you know you follow them and and some of them begin to die and that's how this curve falls off here now these are something 70 year old people and so you see over this time course of several years people begin to dine these curves here the black curve and the red curve are are healthy people as they begin to die in the blue line here are patients with diabetes being treated with a different a different drug and as you can see their their risk of dying is higher the more people die over a shorter period of time but what was really interesting and really surprising is that this green line here our patients with diabetes but treated with metformin so this is striking because not only does this drug reduce the risk of patients with diabetes from diet from dying but actually looks as if small study that they actually survive better in patients without diabetes okay so this really from a human epidemiologic standpoint really raised the question of whether this kind of drug might be actually slowing the aging process in addition to treating diabetes in a way that might be good for everybody in a general sense so so that was the concept and that idea is out there that there may be drugs that can actually slow the aging process then that might be beneficial to the population at large or at least a group of people that could actually be given to people before they develop diseases and they could actually extend their lifespan by by preventing the onset of age-related diseases and this drug metformin is actually being considered by the FDA now for a clinical trial that will be in a sense the first of its kind that is a drug that actually is being used to treat aging itself not a specific disease but treating people and looking for the ability of this drug to delay the onset of these age-related diseases okay so this is a this is a paradigm shift and it's a big issue for the FDA appropriately so as to whether we should be developing drugs that are not for specific diseases that are actually for this process that we're very interested in studying this process of Aging itself um so this you know this this trial is underway and designed and we'll find out more about it so the next drug I want to mention is rapamycin of course this is a drug that um Joan knows very well she's studied it for many years and likewise this is a drug that was found for another reason it was found on Easter Island a Chilean Island so-called Robin Nui and that's where the name rapamycin came from and it was found initially to be basically an antibiotic I think I think an anti-fungal actually and um but then it was found to have very strong immunosuppressive properties as well and now it's used commonly for example in organ transplants um and other other treatments that involve some kind of adjunct immunosuppression well in the same way this drug started to be understood in terms of the um the the proteins that it interacts with in the cell and it became very of Interest as to how this drug rapamycin actually interacts with cellular metabolism as well and in the same way investigators started to study this in model organisms and I think the first evidence of this drug is being kind of a lifespan extension actually was in in yeast and but then in other model organisms and flies and worms and had quite a potent um activity in terms of extending lifespan so so that's again another important kind of Avenue looking at drugs that might be used in this way as modulators and perhaps slowers of Aging but probably the you know the granddaddy intervention for slowing aging is is caloric restriction so withholding calories and this has been around and known since the 1930s here's another a graph of kind of a lifespan curve this is in mice and so here again all the mice are alive in the green you see the control mice they begin to die but half of them are still alive around 30 months of age well if you restrict the calories by 25 or massively 55 or 65 you see the animals live longer and longer and longer and almost a doubling of lifespan um by this really massive caloric restriction in these mice so this has been replicated in in lots of species many many species there's strong evidence that this occurs in primates even that you can actually delay the onset of death delay the onset of age-related diseases by restricting calories and if you're so inclined you can join the caloric restriction society and you can restrict your calories and you can be hungry for a very long time and if you don't get hit by a bus maybe you'll live longer we don't know in humans yet there's certainly evidence from studies of fasting and and other dietary interventions that there is likely to be an effect in humans but we don't have any actual lifespan studies so so we came into this this field of interventions for affecting Aging in a kind of roundabout way and we came into this really from our studies of of stem cells and tissue repair and our our interests came we originally just interested in how tissues repair and the stem cells in the body that repair them but we came interested in the question of why do we lose a lot of this reperative capacity as we get older so in a younger human if you injure a tissue a skin or a bone they heal very very well very very quickly and with very little scar formation but but as we get older we all know this that our our wounds are our injuries heal more slowly often with a lot of scarring and we know that this is not due per se because we run out of stem cells we still have plenty of stem cells but we the stem cells and this is something we've studied in detail begin to lose their efficacy in terms of tissue repair and tissue regeneration so the tissue that we've studied primarily is little muscle and I'll just show some basically representation of how good muscle is at repairing itself so just like Skin So on the top here these are a microscopic view of a muscle from a mouse and then after a few days of a total necrotic injury to that tissue from a toxin you see a destruction of that architecture and after a few days you start to see the formation of these newly forming kind of muscle muscle fibers that over the course of a few weeks grow and restore that tissue so really this remarkable regenerative capacity to to basically go from a totally damaged tissue back to a normal tissue well that capacity does decline with age and this is Illustrated in this slide from some data from our lab in the mouse and this has been known um before we did this but we're just illustrating it here so these are muscles from a young mouse or an old mouse here's the uninjured muscle after a first injury a second injury we still get very very good repair but in the old animals even after a single injury you start to see these areas in the whitish areas that are the beginning of scar tissue formation after second injury you see a lot more Scar Tissue formation and some of this blue area here is is more inflammation so just the the ability to repair is something that we that we see declines with age so we became very interested in asking can we intervene in a way to restore this youthful reparative capacity to Old tissues and old animals and we had evidence to to support the idea that some of the enhanced repair in the young animal comes from positive reparative factors in the blood and some of the in declining regenerative capacity with age came from suppressive activities in the blood and this led us to do this very strange but but but turning out to be a very important experiment using this technique called parabiosis and parabiosis is a technique whereby animals are surgically connected and they develop a single shared circulatory system so the tissues of one animal are exposed to the circulating environment of the other animal and these kind of control pairs are so-called isochronic so same age young animal to Young animal or old animal to Old animal but the interesting experiment of the so-called heterochronic parabolic pairs where a young animal is connected to an old animal so these animals again develop this shared circulatory system and the old animal over a few weeks begins to be exposed over and over to the environment to the circulation of this young animal and we asked the question what effect does that exposure to this young blood have on this old Animal by then looking at for example its muscle stem cells and its ability to respond to a muscle injury so we did these experiments where we would introduce an injury into the either control pairs or these heterochronic pairs and what we found was really quite striking so in these control pairs this is an early phase of regeneration this is take my word for it very healthy regeneration in the in the old Partners old to old we start to see a lot of this fibrosis that I mentioned a lot of scarring but in the old animal that had been connected to the young animal for some period of weeks they repair just as well as young animals so and we were able to find we've done many more studies on this that there's really a restoration of the stem cells that engage in this repair from an old state to a young state so that we really seem to be reprogramming in a sense these old cells to become younger so is this truly Rejuvenation and that's that's the kind of the million-dollar question and and really from everything we study from a functional perspective to a molecular perspective it appears as if these cells and tissues are in fact acquiring a more youthful state so just by that definition until we have a true molecular definition of cellular age we we're working on this this looks like a true Rejuvenation so moving cells and tissues back from an age State back to a younger state to a kind of reprogramming so we published this in the early 2000s looking at both muscle and liver and then collaboratively with our colleague at Stanford Tony West Corey we started looking at the brain and nurse neurostem cells and then over the many next years many other tissues were examined in these heterochonic parabolic pairs and found to show restoration of youthful function in the spinal cord the pancreas the heart brain vasculature Etc et cetera so many many tissues have been have been studied have been shown to have this rejuvenating effect by exposure to Young Blood of course this doesn't escape the popular imagination this is from a um a episode of called blood boy from from Silicon Valley the satirical HBO Comedy in which this older entrepreneur is getting an infusion of blood from this this young healthy male with the idea this is going to help him live longer and healthier um over time but our question is are there more practical interventions we're obviously not going to be probiotically carrying humans um that would restore youthful function to Old cells and this this circles back to again the main topic of today which is exercise and Hippocrates it said had written um eating alone will not keep a man well he must also take exercise of course hypocrisy I guess didn't know about restrictions so you might have said eating less not only keeping manual but he must also exercise but clearly there was there has been this idea of the benefit of exercise to Health and Longevity uh for for centuries and millennia so this is just an article that I like from The New York Times um because I too like Dan I'm a runner I run marathons and according to the article um an hour of running may had seven hours to your life so I like the math so I guess if I just keep running I can just basically get achieve what they call escape velocity and just keep running and running and running forever I don't know if that will work but I'm working on it but this is a this is a slide from a an NIH program called motor pack which is the molecular transducers of physical activity which asks this fundamental question that Dan raised and then I'll uh that I am talking about which is why does exercise do this I mean what do we what is it that happens when we exercise that reduces our susceptibility to all these diseases whether it's lung cancer or diabetes heart attack and a cardiovascular disease bone health muscle Health brain health I mean all of these are well known but really have little idea at this point on what the real molecular transducers are of physical activities and and this is actually Dan referred to this to this idea that muscle does not only um move our body move our joints but it's actually a secretory organ so muscle secretes things and it secretes things locally and it secretes things into the blood these so-called myokines that Dan mentioned there are these positive regulars of metabolism but they have positive effects on fat on liver on on pancreas on bone and so the question really is are these myocons are what's secreted by muscle are these the mediators and the more we exercise the more positive things are secreted from our muscle both locally and then into our blood that might be mediating these beneficial effects so I want to just talk about how the evidence we have that these might be acting on stem cells and some of the first evidence of this actually came from Rusty Gage's Lab at the Salk Institute in which they they found that exercise just in the form of wheel running had this profound effect on stem cells in the brain so-called neural stem cells leading to so-called enhanced neurogenesis the forming and formation of new neurons and these are neurostem cells in the area of the brain that are important for learning and memory and it was clear that that exercise can stimulate these neurostem cells and this enhancement of of learning and memory as perhaps one of the most profound things you can do to enhance brain stimulation and neurogenesis so a few years ago we asked the question does exercise actually rejuvenate old muscle stem cells so the way we do this experiment is we put mice on one of these running wheels and we exercise them for a few weeks and then we again looked at their muscle injury responses and this is work done by a former mdphd student lab Jimmy Brett and a current postdoc in the lab Marina Arjona and what we found was really quite striking so again my run for run on a running wheel for three weeks and then we injure the muscle and we measure on the y-axis here is just an index of the Regeneration so how well the muscles would generate in young versus old mice what was interesting is we then had some mice not exercise in some mice exercise exercise had very little effect on the young mice in terms of this muscle regeneration but in the old mice which have an impaired regeneration compared to Young exercise almost restored this regeneration back to a young level so in a way similar to what we saw with the probiotic experiments so clearly exercise was having this this impact on this repair and we looked at actually the muscle stem cells and we asked what are the genes that are turned on in these old stem cells in response to exercise and this is just a complicated plot looking at lots and lots of genes but what you see high up here that the gene that was the most highly induced in response to exercise is this Gene Cyclone D1 which is a very famous Gene in terms of regulating cell proliferation so-called cell cycle so we ended up doing a lot of experiments which I won't go into in which we either reduce the levels of cyclin D1 and we show that that impaired the ability of exercise to enhance muscle repair so clearly this Gene its induction is important for this exercise response and equally importantly if we maintain cyclin D1 levels high in old muscle stem cells we could enhance the repair of muscle in the old animals so clearly cycling D1 is playing a pivotal role in the stem cell population and in response to exercise so this is just our kind of working model of how this looks so here you have young mice and old mice and we look at their muscle stem cells from the from these hind limb muscles cycling D1 levels go down with age and with that decline you see an impairment at this regenerative response but with exercise you can induce even in the older animals the cycling D1 back up to a more youthful level and and you can get important improved regeneration so what we don't know is if this is the same pathway that works in other stem cells but this is what we're interested in studying and how this is regulated and again if there are factors in the blood that can be identified that can lead to this response they could potentially be turned in some some kind of therapeutic not exercise pill as Dan said but at least Therapeutics that could potentially enhance different aspects of of stem cell function that change with age so I'm just going to end with with two more interesting pieces of data from these studies and the first is something that will be familiar to anyone who trains and then stops training and that is the effect of exercise is transient we run these mice on a wheel for three weeks and again we're looking here at kind of a stem cell function immediately after three weeks of exercise that function is improved then of course of one week two weeks as we all know that benefit declines and so once you stop training you know that your your Fitness goes down fairly quickly and and goes back down to Baseline so so that's no surprise but the the molecular Pathways and the cellular class Pathways kind of parallel what we know has happened physiologically and then the last piece of data I want to share is if we took old mice and we transfuse them with blood either from another old mouse that had not exercised or from an old mouse that had exercised we asked what does the effect of those plasma transfers have on stem cell function and what we found this is just shown here on the graph on the right is that the effects of transfer of plasma from non-exercised mice is much less compared to the exercise mice so this just says that there actually is something in the blood of mice that exercise that can be transferred by a blood transfusion into another animal to produce the benefit of that exercise just confirming or or supporting the idea that there are factors within the blood that are mediating this beneficial effect that potentially could be identified and could potentially be translating to some kind of therapeutic okay so let me just end by again talking about this idea of Aging as a this is the Fountain of Youth Of course and um can it be um reversible can it be reversed is aging reversible we know that aging is malleable in the sense that we can slow aging we can delay the processes that change but from this kind of data as well as other data from other kinds of experiments there's increasing interest in the idea that at least aspects of the Aging of cells and tissues can be reversed at least at least transiently and I think from a point of view of Therapeutics one can really imagine that being translated into tissue repair so the time of a bone fracture or the time of a skin wound could you introduce some kind of therapeutic in this way that could restore youthful function to the older stem cells to enhance their care at least of that tissue during that time so I think that's that's where we think of this beginning and then extending that more to longer term treatments in terms of um delaying the onset of age-related diseases
