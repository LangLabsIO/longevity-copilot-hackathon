[Music] i'm a professor uh at harvard and mit specializing in biotechnology development including reading and writing and editing of dna and anything that you can do with dna ranging from information encoding all the way up to [Music] organ transplants and ecosystems aging affects almost every source of human morbidity and mortality maybe maybe it's not the only influencer but it's a it it influences all kinds of things um ranging from covet 19 where there's a huge age effect to even falling probability of falling down or the probability of getting up afterwards that's all age related so then you have a choice between longevity and aging reversal the problem with longevity is it takes decades to prove your point to the fda ema whatever organizations and to do the experiments or even 10 is 20 is prohibitive but with aging reversal you can see you can see effects um in weeks and that and that's and that's the goal so uh it could it also a third reason is it has a strong possibility of being something that we all need um certainly we all do die of aging something else doesn't get us first and uh and so it could be a big market which means a low cost meaning that because the fixed costs of r d are amortized over um a large population so those are the attractions of aging reversal in particular and what we've done there is two categories aging versus 11 many different methods and pathways shown for animals but we've been employing two categories one is what we call cell autonomous meaning that it only works in the cell to which you deliver the therapy things like telomerase or the transcription factors that um shin and yamanaka got the nobel prize for reversing aging all the way back from 80 years to zero you can use that in limited doses to get moderate aging reversal in in mice and we just co-authored a paper with david sinclair's lab in nature showing that that could be applied uh in a uh aav gene therapy delivery scenario and it works very well considering it only affects the cells you deliver it to the other i think is even more exciting and broader in the you deliver it to some cells and may have impact on adjacent cells or even sometimes the entire body and so uh that's we call it cell non-autonomous spreads from the cell you deliver it to and we we tested about 45 such gene therapies uh we in this case being nova noah davidson as a postdoctoral fellow in my lab and then later um uh he and dan oliver and i co-founded rejuvenate bio a startup company to do the same thing and we've done it in mice we've now done it in dogs the dogs is intended to be a veterinary product in and of itself but also a segue into human clinical trials that we hope will be starting soon of those 45 genes we whittled it down to three and various combinations of those three seem to handle a very large number of different diseases that have little in common other than their age related and these are things like type 2 diabetes osteoarthritis kidney heart failure mitral valve disease and neurodegenerative diseases so so we're encouraged to think that may be getting at the core of aging rather than at some um symptom we're just dealing with a very specific except of a very specific disease and so that's where we that's where we're headed with it uh um right now [Music] you
