so [Music] so i have a question from deepika who wants to know when would one start with anti-aging intervention is there an optional age at which one should begin so of course this is entrance intrinsic forensics so both well so so i'm extrapolating from the the hundreds of animal studies that have been done uh everything from fruit flies to little worms mice uh even dogs and some some monkey studies so we have a big database to pull information but um we don't know about humans i would say that in my scientific opinion uh around the age of 30 aging starts to kick in and actually make your system not work very well you start to slow down with healing in sports so i myself started taking resvertrol when i was 34 and i'm still doing okay i'm still alive doesn't seem to be hurting and it's not very expensive so the trade-off is such that uh in my 30s it was worth trying and certainly now that i'm in my 50s it's definitely worth trying something um think about this we know what's going to happen to all of us if we don't do anything so as long as it's safe and it's not going to break your budget i think especially the older you get the more uh worth it it is to try some things but it's all individual i would say if you're in your 20s or teens there's very little reason to do things other than eat healthy and exercise um but that's best advice would a couple of glasses of wine work as well well that's debated i think it any any doctor would say in moderation a glass a day of red wine will probably do do you some good um you don't want to overdo it of course alcohol will will wreck your liver long term but um there are many healthy molecules in red wine resveratrol is one but there are many others from from the grapes that are preserved in the wine and i think that's one of the main reasons that red wine is actually so healthy but how long do you have to take or drink red wine to have an effect probably a decade or so would be in would be a minimum the reason is that red wine doesn't have much resveratrol in it maybe a milligram and in our studies we give the mice the equivalent of 100 to 200 glasses a day so yeah fortunately it's in a pill or in in their food but uh yeah i don't recommend drinking that much [Music] [Applause] you
