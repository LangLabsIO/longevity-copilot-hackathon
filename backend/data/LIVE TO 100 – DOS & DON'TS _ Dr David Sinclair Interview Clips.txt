[Music] I mean you want to start early in life you can't decide at 80 that this is a good idea this big effect so the kind of things that I do is I avoid radiation as much as I can particularly x-rays um they will damage your chromosomes uh although my dentist forced me to have one last week even though I objected which is a separate ethical question whether possible chemicals so a number of chemicals in our world Plastics and food dyes and even the yellow printer in ink in those inkjet printers is can damage your DNA and probably accelerate aging um and and other things that you know flying is bad I mean we could stretch it out uh or go broad a poor sleep huge amounts of mental stress lack of exercise sitting around eating too much becoming obese and smoking these are all things that will accelerate aging we we know that if you get sunburned too much you'll get older and we know that that accelerates this clock because it's breaking the chromosomes um I used to be skeptical that that I could live an extra five years I'm I'm now convinced that I'm I could live another 20. uh beyond what I normally would have and the reason is this if you do the right things sleep well eat well don't get don't eat too much restrict your feeding so eat rarely I eat one meal a day and do some exercise and don't smoke those things will give you at least an extra 14 years of life on average if you're an average person um that's the easy stuff this other stuff that I that I supplement with and the drugs that are coming soon including metformin which is on the market I believe will get us to 20 quite easily and then from there you know then then I'm at 100 potentially then what you know I'm just going to keep working away and I think we're going to just keep chipping away at average lifespan but uh it's it's a world now where there's a lot more investment and research and they've been big breakthroughs just in the last two years um and I've never been more excited about the prospect of human health than I am right now I would like to see the future I would like to stick around for as long as I can so that I can have as greater impact as possible and do I think about my leica's legacy yes I have since I was age four and I started on this quest to make the world a much better place and ultimately show future historians that Humanity can do much better than we did in the 20th century foreign [Music]
