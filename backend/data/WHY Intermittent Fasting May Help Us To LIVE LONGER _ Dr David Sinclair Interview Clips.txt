[Music] i'd be totally shocked if intermittent fasting didn't help people live longer certainly healthier so this has been known for thousands of years we we're not that smart but what we have figured out we think is that it works because it turns on the body's defenses against disease and aging and uh gil and i have worked on some of these genes called sirtuins and there are other ones there's one called ampk that controls energy mtor controls defenses in response to amino acid levels uh and so what you do when you fast is you turn on these defenses and if you sit around and become too obese and you eat constantly these defenses won't actually be activated and that's the reason i think they primarily work it's not that blood flows better or just that insulin sensitivity changes you really are turning on every cell's defenses against dna damage against uh toxins everything that that causes diseases it seems that these defenses have a way to slow down the negative effects one thing i would say that's changed my life a lot is to eat less often and i've gotten my 20 year old body back i feel great i sleep well i've always skipped breakfast as best i could i'm not a morning breakfast guy but if you need breakfast i would say let's skip dinner or just have a really small one because that period of your body not having food to process is i believe extraordinarily beneficial and it's not that hard but i wouldn't start with skipping two meals a day and all snacks it's too hard to do that but work your way up to it i drink a lot of coffee and tea and then hot water and then just cold water it fill i fill myself up with liquids and that's the best way to get rid of that that feeling to go eat but also if you're anything like me 80 of eating is just because you're bored or you want to do something or you don't actually need to eat um and so there's also this mindset you do need that ability to say i know brain you want me to go do that but i'm not going to do it and that takes some willpower it's not simple but actually once you get to my stage and it takes about three weeks it feels weird to eat that much and you'll certainly look and feel better because of it [Music] you
