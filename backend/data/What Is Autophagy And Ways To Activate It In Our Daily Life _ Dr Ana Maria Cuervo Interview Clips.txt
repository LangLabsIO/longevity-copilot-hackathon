[Music] autophagy is something that happens in all the cells of your body every single day if you are healthy i mean autophagy should happen and it's a process that take care of recycling everything that is inside your cell so it's the perfect recycling machinery that is gonna take anything that is not useful anymore inside yourself or that is damaged or that you just don't need anymore and it's going to break it in pieces and it's going to use those pieces to build new products so basically as i say this is like the best example in the world of perfect recycling you associate this process of removing garbage to this process of generating energy for your cells to continue living so it's the same way that you know at home when you clean you have different tools right like you have the vacuum or you have the mob so so the cell also have different ways of cleaning and recycling and the difference is mostly how do you take things into the garbage container so for example macro autophagy so that's normally a way kind of creating a bag where you put all these big structures inside the cell that you don't need anymore and then you bring them to the recycling container and then if you do that in a smaller scale it's what is called micro so you have macro autophagy and micro autophagy and it just basically depends on the size of the of the bag of garbage but then you have this third process that is known as chaparral mediated autophagy and actually that's the one that we discover by crossing the atlantic back and forward and i always image it more like you know these garbage pickers that you have that is a stick and you just pick things from the floor just to recycle because then rather than trapping it inside the bag you just pick what is wrong or what you want to eliminate and put it in the recycling compartment so it's a much more selective way of eliminating the bad from the good in a very a very exquisite manner so there are different stimuli so as i mentioned autofocus is a mechanism that is continuously going on in your cell but you also have the ability to enhance it or increase it in response to a stress so the very first characterizes stress is actually starvation like lack of nutrients when your cells and that's how it was described in the early 60s when your cells don't have nutrients for example your liver in between lunch and dinner if you don't snack in the middle the hepatocytes need energy because they need to provide also energy to other cells in your body so what they do is they activate autophagy and it's a way to do some cleaning around and provide energy energy and maintain so starvation is the typical example of an activation activator of autophagy but for example oxidative stress when you have damage inside the cell autophagy gets activated to clean up mitochondria or any other thing that could become damaged and then the more we learn that there are very elegant ways like signaling mechanisms that can activate autophagy without you having to fully establish so for example widow cromer is one of the big pioneers on that area you are probably familiar with the idea that calorie restriction is one of the interventions that stand healthy lifespan and one of the basis of why calorie restriction work is actually because it activate out tofa but you know in our um society is going to be very difficult to do full calorie restriction because it's 60 calories so for example the group of widow chromer has been identifying what is the signaling mechanism by which starvation activate autophagy and then looking for compounds molecules that could do the same and he actually called them caloric magnetics because they mimic calorie restriction but you can still eat and there are agents like spermidine for example you have them in broccoli so so spermidine is an activator of autophagy even in normal nutritional status because it follows the same pathway that will do starvation in that case so other compounds rapamycin metformin so many of these compounds that i'm sure you've been discussing in the program as compounds that activate healthy lifespan they really also activate autophagy and there is very elegant work showing that part of this beneficial effect of these agents and this intervention is because of the activation of autophagy because if you eliminate autophagy you don't have the beneficial effect of calorie restriction or any of these magnetics [Music] you
