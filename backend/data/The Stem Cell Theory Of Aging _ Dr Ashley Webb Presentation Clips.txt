[Music] foreign s out that if you look across different tissues different tissues are actually renewed at different rates so basically within any given tissue there are specific needs or demands of the stem cell pool that are particular to that Niche and environment so some tissues in in mammals are tissues that have constant turnover or high turnover so examples of this are the the hematopoetic system where the stem cells which are human aquatic stem cells reside in bone marrow as well as intestine testimism is a very high turnover tissue and the stem cells reside in the Crypt of the intestine and they're very important for regenerating epithelial of the intestine and the skin is also a high turnover tissue and stem cells are are critical for maintaining um healthy skin during the aging process some tissues have much lower turnover so the brain is an example of this um though there are two specialized neural stem cell niches and neurogenesis or the formation of new neurons from stem cells in these niches is important for healthy aging and maintenance of cognitive function and sensory functions with age now in the skeletal muscle and the stem cells are known as satellite cells and these cells are important for the repair process um after after damage to skeletal muscle now stem cell exhaustion is one of the major Hallmarks of Aging so most people aren't familiar at this point um with this concept of Hallmarks of Aging so these are are processes that are are involved in aging and decline in tissue functioning with age and so stem cell exhaustion meets the criteria as a Hallmark of aging and so that means that it is it is observed in normal physiological aging and that defects in stem cell function can actually accelerate tissue aging and then Rejuvenation of stem cells or if you increase their functionality that can actually enhance repair or um or improve aging symptoms within that tissue and so uh the stem cell theory of Aging is one of several theories of aging and um and it's just one contributor to the aging process and so the stem cell theory of Aging posits that aging is a result of the failure of stem cells to replenish cells across tissues and that this results in a loss of tissue and organ function during aging and so as I mentioned aging is accompanied by stem cell defects that affect various tissues across the body and stem cell proliferation generally decreases with age however there are exceptions to this Rule and I'll mention um some exceptions in upcoming slides now during aging there's also a skewing of stem cell lineages and so as I'll mentioned in upcoming slides some stem cells will actually generate different types of differentiated cells with age it's also now known that there's an overall depletion of stem cell pools with age and that this is due to a loss of quiescent cells and so once these quiescent stem cells are lost this is very detrimental to the the lineage because there's no longer a reservoir for a differentiated cells once these kind of quiescent stem cells are depleted it's also been shown that the quiescent stem cells that remain in the Aged body will actually drift deeper into a quiescent state and so this is also also detrimental to the lineage because it means that these quiescent stem cells are actually much harder to activate so it's harder to get them out of the quiescent state into the actively proliferating state in order to to go on and differentiate and contribute to repair so all of this together results in a failed maintenance of tissues as well as a decrease in regenerative regeneration of tissues with age so a lot of what we know about this stem cell theory of aging and support for stem cell 3 of Aging comes from normal physiological aging and observations um in terms of what happens to just normal stem cells during the normal aging process however there's also evidence for this Theory from accelerated aging syndromes and accelerated aging models so for example on Hutchinson Guilford Bridge area is an accelerated aging syndrome that results from mutations in the laminate aging and so this individual here has Hutchinson Guilford Bridge area and you can see he exhibits a number of features of accelerated aging although he's he's quite Young so for example there's a thinning and wrinkling of the skin that occurs there's decreased muscle mass increased joint stiffness as well as an overall decrease in lifespan and so uh there are also Mouse models of Hutchinson Gilbert Progeria an investigation of these Mouse models has confirmed that there's a depletion of stem cell pools in this bridge area so for example here uh looking at a section through a hair follicle in Wild Titan mice there are numbers a large number of stem cells that are present in the hair follicle those are shown here in red but in the Progeria model that recapitially recapitulates the symptoms of lamin a mutations um there is a depletion of these stem cell tools so there's a loss of the red signal here this isn't limited to just Hutchinson Gilford Progeria it's also been observed in Warner syndrome another progeria and even in the individuals that have these syndromes there's a depletion of mesenchymal stem cells that have features of premature aging [Music]
