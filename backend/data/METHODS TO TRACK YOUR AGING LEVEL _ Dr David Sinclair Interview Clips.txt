[Music] think how do you track your aging because for instance i i told you oh you look younger and you say oh monty you look younger but then maybe my body inside is super old i don't know but i don't see it from outside is it any way to track your aging level uh that normal people without being a scientist that we could do there are now there are different levels of testing um the easiest is just to to ask how many push-ups can you do and people who are our age typically cannot even do 10 um if you can do 20 you're doing well but that of course depends on practice there's another test that is good which is you sit down with your legs crossed and then try to get up without touching your hands on the floor right and if you can do that you're in very good shape uh most 50 year olds cannot do that they have to push up with a hand oh my goodness i can't wait to do the test all right as our muscles are losing strength all the time as at our age an older person in their 60s will often have to get onto one knee to get up and so that's an easy test everyone can do that you know today there's an another test which is a little bit more uh difficult but you can there are companies that do this so my my the company that i use is called inside tracker and if you don't have it in europe you can actually upload your blood tests get a doctor to do the blood test inside tracker over here and and i'm a consultant and an investor in this company i have to disclose i want to disclose uh but what they do is they they send a nurse or i mean a phlebotomist to the house or you can have a test and then you get the results back and what they tell you is here's your optimal range for this measurement they take about 35 measurements and this is a graph on how you you're doing right i've been doing that for 11 years and i've been optimizing my body as best i can how old am i well they calculated that um last time i did it really i was down to 30 years of age by their measurements so that that's that's promising there's a new test which i want to tell you about quickly is that remember i said the epi genome is important for aging and in our paper that's coming out in december we show that we can reset the epigenome basically push the reset button and restore the hard drive or restore the software you can measure the epigenetic changes there's a particular one called dna methylation and this is just a chemical that gets added to our dna as we get older and subtracted and you can measure those and if you plug that data into a computer it can tell you your biological age and some people are much older or younger than their actual birthday candles and it correlates if you if you don't look after your body typically you'll be older and vice versa and you can predict when you're going to die based on that data [Music] you
