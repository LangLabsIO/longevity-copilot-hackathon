[Music] you can reprogram cells to reverse the clock and survive damage in the petri dish where there's just one type of cell and in the eye we can take those retinas out we can look at the cells and and actually measure what's going on inside those cells those neurons and the neurons themselves have have reset their age and and their gene expression it's it's what we would call a cell autonomous effect so it cannot be that the eyes are relying on the stem cells because the viruses that we deliver the gene therapy goes to the to the neurons and only those neurons that get the gene therapy are the ones that get rejuvenated so two adjacent nerve cells in the retina if one gets the treatment the virus which we can see we can stain it another one doesn't only this one will rejuvenate and survive and grow and this one won't we don't see any replacement of cells we can look in the eye and all of the cells that were there before are still there after the treatment they haven't been replaced they haven't been substituted by stem cells it's the actual old cells that have been rejuvenated and they have to get those genes into them into each cell for them to get younger cells are not talking to each other or replacing each other each cell acts as though it's it's its own individual and we reprogram them individually because our treatment doesn't infect every neuron in the retina i think we're getting about half of them can very easily see that those ones that didn't get the treatment will die off or they they're not the ones that um become youthful again those we see regenerate are the original nerves because we we tag them with a dye so we don't see them being replaced so we can say yeah they're not being replaced by stem cells and in the case of the old eye we're not damaging anything this is just natural aging and there we can reprogram those retinas those retinas don't look any different they haven't changed they haven't multiplied there are no new cells but the nerve cells now we put an electrode in the back of the eye and those nerves are now functioning with electrical signals like they were young again and then we test the vision of the mice and they can see again can reverse aging in the in the dish so we grow human neurons and we can look at whether they are rejuvenated and they survive and uh and we don't have stem cells in the dish but those nerve cells with the treatment the yamanaka treatment are respond to reprogramming so it doesn't require stem cells for it to work [Music] you
