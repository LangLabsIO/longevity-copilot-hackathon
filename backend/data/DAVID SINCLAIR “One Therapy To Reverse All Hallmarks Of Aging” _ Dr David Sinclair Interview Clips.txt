so [Music] so far my question is how confident are you that a single type of intervention this epigenetic reprogramming will be sufficient to deal with all the downstream hallmarks of aging and this is kind of a opposed to other approaches to rejuvenation which seemed to suggest that multiple separate interventions will be necessary on a regular basis right well i'm not not certain that reprogramming is the only thing we need we're going to need synalytics perhaps some telomerase activators that there are a lot of other things that that could help get us beyond uh you know 120 maximum that said that this reprogramming discovery is so fundamental it's it's as though we've discovered something that we weren't even expecting it truly will be a paradigm shift what we've published um and i wrote in the book is that we horvath found the clock so imagine we have a clock on the wall and we um we think that the clock just is an indicator of time what our new results suggest is that that clock is actually controlling time and when we move the hands backwards we actually get get to rewind back youth and that we have a backup copy of our epigenome that we can access using uh yamanaka factors which you'll read about um probably in another few pages why is that important well when we've treated mice we see all of the hallmarks of aging go backwards and forwards by the way we can also epigenetically age mice and we give them aging and so it's possible that and what i propose in my book and in things that i'm writing now is that this epigenetic theory this information theory of aging can explain all of the hallmarks and if that's true then by addressing uh the epigenome these other hallmarks may by and large go away and that's what we're actually seeing in mice now by restoring vision in old mice and if we can restore vision in old mice it's it's exciting to think what else we might be able to reprogram but i don't know if it's perfect it's early days and i still think it's worth pushing ahead very hard with these other approaches addressing the hallmarks individually as well [Music] [Applause] [Music] you
