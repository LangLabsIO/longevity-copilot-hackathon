so [Music] metformin is a drug that's given to type 2 diabetics who have high blood sugar and what was discovered by accident was looking at people who take metformin and looking at what other diseases they get or don't get in this case and of course people are healthier with their blood sugar levels but those people also live longer than people that don't take metformin and they're also protected against heart disease and cancer and frailty and so i i'm really excited about metformin as a way for people who don't yet have type 2 diabetes to slow down aging and protect against those other diseases and we've calculated that by taking metformin you could that's a lot of hearts thank you but by taking metformin you could make people live a few years longer at least maybe 10 at least a few and that would save the us economy of value to the us economy and 86 trillion dollars over the next few decades so i know we're not into economies and here and money here but often people think well what can happen if we have all these older people well if they're healthier and they live longer they cost much less and there's so much money that we waste on practicing sick care not health care yeah um so i take a gram of metformin most days of the week sometimes i don't because i'm one of the 20 of people that have a rough time with it in my stomach i need a bit of some a bit of food in my stomach to be able to tolerate it but i am going to try the slow release version or the pure reforms yeah we were talking about that yeah my stuff isn't necessarily ultra pure so i'm going to try that but metformin works in part by turning on the mitochondria making my mitochondria more energetic and more numerous and that's really important because having more energy allows your cells to repair better but by the way the metformin also activates these genes that i work on so it's a double of impact uh another question actually that came up quite a bit before the live just uh when people had sent in via text and through the direct messages was about burberry and i also saw that question come up a lot just in the course of this live as well as an alternative to metformin for people who are trying to take something that's a little bit more natural and that's where their comfort zone is when it comes to supplementation it's a great option and we've studied berberine in my lab and it works really well in in the animal studies for diabetes and for revving up mitochondria and in fact i used to take berberine before i had access to metformin which requires prescription berberine you can buy at any pharmacy or online right again you want to look for purity and trusted brands gmp but berberine should be yellow uh not white but i think it's a great alternative and if you look at the science behind it there have been some really convincing human studies of people taking one to two grams a day and they have benefits with their blood sugar which is similar to what metformin does it's slightly less potent of course it's not a drug but i think it's a great alternative um is there uh and and you may not be able to answer this question but is there a specific amount that you would recommend to uh achieve the same results if someone chooses to use berberine instead of performance uh yeah um so in case um my colleagues and employer are listening none of this is a recommendation um i don't do that it's scientific information and my personal view um and and always consult a doctor and you want to do blood tests to make sure that this is working and you're not hurting your body particularly the liver um ast and alt are two things you can measure to make sure your liver is doing well and i always do that i've been monitoring myself for over a decade to make sure that anything that i tried is not doing me harm because i need to know that before i talk about it with other people and i know serena you're the same yes very much the same for uh for those of you who don't know what we always i always run labs have labs done you know any clients before i make recommendations and it's something that i do regularly and i recommend other people to bring in as well at least every six months if not three so that you know what's happening inside your body yeah so the doses in the clinical trials are one to two grams a day again i think it's not very soluble so you probably wouldn't want to mix it or eat it with food for it to get absorbed [Music] [Music] you
