[Music] thing uh the other thing we were talking about with supplements is a collagen so you know we kind of just touched on it briefly but i think that some people would really love to hear whether or not collagen supplements are actually good for them or they're not short-term and long-term benefits and you know kind of setbacks from collagen if you could dive into that right so collagen is the most abundant protein in your body uh it's it's important for your muscle hold it together and your skin and as you get older you make less collagen and you degrade it and leads to the look of aging but it's an essential protein and it's a really interesting one from a biochemical uh a biologist standpoint it's made as a triple helix not not double helix like dna but it's triple and to stabilize it because it needs to be there for years the cell does what's called hydroxyl prolation and it just puts little oxygen and hydrogens onto collagen and that stabilizes it and what this uh ends up doing is it acts as a little signal to cells when they see this hydroxylation it can actually do good things and so what has been discovered is that when you eat collagen it actually does seem to and some clinical trials seems to improve hair hair and skin and they promote the gross growth of muscle cells and differentiation turning into muscle cells um how does it do that well i was skeptical i from what i know if you eat collagen which is a protein it's unlikely to work because your body will digest it and you'll just have amino acids and amino acids are amino acids i'm open to the idea that eating digested collagen in the form of gummies or drinks there's a various there are various ways to take it in could actually do what the chinese have been saying for centuries which is it promotes the growth of things that are made of collagen as well okay great so thank you for covering that we had a lot of questions about that um and a question that just came up to the amino acids in collagen activate and excuse me yeah i mean the ones that are that are important that they go by various names there's one called hydroxyl prologue glycine the other one's proliferoxyl proline but basically it's just proline with another amino acid or two next to it with that oxygen hydrogen but you don't need to know that it's just you know interesting from a scientist's point of view that they're potentially the body says oh there's a wound there's collagen being released and digested i need to grow that wound and heal it and by eating collagen you can actually get these dipeptides into your body they can be found in the bloodstream and that might be how they're promoting skin growth hair growth and even wound healing [Music] you
