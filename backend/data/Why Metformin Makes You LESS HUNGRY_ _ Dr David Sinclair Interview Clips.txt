[Music] oh well i'm not exactly sure but it's well known and i've experienced the same now i could give you a theory why it does that metformin uh also is is acting on your stomach walls uh a lot of people actually they feel so what do you call it disrupted in their ingestion uh in digestive system that they stopped taking it but you do eventually get used to it again give it a week or two so metformin can actually change the chemistry of cells it revs up their metabolism but it also can lead to something called lactic acidosis which is a little too much of that and your body starts producing like lactic acid right when you're exercising or running a marathon and i think that could be what's happening to our stomachs when we met from it initially once before we get used to it or if we don't take it with a bit of food like milk to protect the lining of the stomach i think that's what's going on but i actually really like it if i take it with a bit of food then i'm not hungry for many many hours and i've lost weight it's actually a great weight loss pill as well but like you said it does reduce your blood sugar but not below normal levels it'll actually it'll stop unless you take a mega dose but the other good thing to know about blood sugar is that if you're eating big meals during the day your blood sugar is doing this and i've measured it it's true for me as well now if if we're having small meals or fasting what happens is your blood sugar goes down but it'll your liver will compensate you your liver makes sugar called gluconeogenesis and i find that i have a beautiful stable glucose glucose throughout the day whereas if i'm eating it's going up crash below up crash below and that's where you get this hunger and i'm feeling full and distracted i can't think it's it's wonderful not being subject to the fridge the whims of having to go and get the food out of the fridge and like you say you can just power through the day [Music] [Music] you
