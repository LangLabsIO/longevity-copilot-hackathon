[Music] i definitely didn't foresee this future 10 years ago i mean i generally did but it's much more exciting than i could have predicted uh i am opening up my lab we are going to be a social media lab soon which i think will be great because we do need to inspire students young teenagers especially those from backgrounds that don't even consider science as a career now so i'll be talking about this but just as a preview what we are doing in my lab is so we've got this ability to dial up aging in the forwards in reverse direction we've got the ability to reprogram tissues to make them younger we're looking at recovering memory uh and the ability to learn in old mice so far that's looking promising by changing the age of the brain ah we're looking at skin spinal cord injury we have other projects we are looking at ways to protect the genome from damage and epigenetic changes we have a protein that comes from very stress resistant and ra radiation resistant bacteria that one's coming to fruition we've looked at resveratrol in more detail than probably anyone cares to um it was controversial because fires are basically attacked by science for whatever reason you can you can probably guess but uh you know that they said resveratrol doesn't it doesn't act on cert one the enzyme uh nor do the drugs we were developing well you know it essentially screwed up that entire field of medicine unfortunately we're trying to revive it but what they didn't do was to crush the science and uh we prevailed showing that resveratrol does activate sur1 and the new study is to make we made a mouse that doesn't get activated by resveratrol just by changing one amino acid in the enzyme and we could test whether resveratrol has a benefit on those mice and the answer is it doesn't it's blocked by this certain one activation mutant which to me really finally nails it but you know i'll use this as a platform to tell you and your your audience that once something some idea gets out in the media it's really hard to reverse it and i still meet people who say oh yeah all that stuff from your lab was bs when you know since 2013 it's been proven to be right in science and nature papers by us and others but we'll you know we'll continue moving on there's nothing much you can do about public perception except do your best and do good research in my lab what it's like is if you come up with an experiment you have to justify why it's important for the world and why would anyone care and we don't work the way a lot of labs do most labs say well we have this this animal or this worm and we have this technique of knocking those genes out let's just knock jeans out in the worm we don't do that we sit back and we say what are the big unsolved questions of humanity and then we figure out how to solve that with new technologies and new models which is really hard in my lab you've got to be brave because we it's it's risky and you've just got to think on your feet and often our papers have a lot of authors because we have to have expertise in pathology and machine learning we've built our own computers uh it takes a lot and i don't profess to know everything so you have to be the world's expert in my lab at what you do but uh what's it like being a scientist well it it's thrilling to do something that is at the forefront of human knowledge when i was graduate student it was the best time of my life it is stressful it's a lot of work you do have to work on weekends typically and it can be stressful when your projects fail or experiments fail but no one in my lab has ever failed in the long run and what you need to do is select a supervisor that ensures that you take calculated risks so you could have a risky project but also a middle one and a really safe one just in case [Music] [Music] you
