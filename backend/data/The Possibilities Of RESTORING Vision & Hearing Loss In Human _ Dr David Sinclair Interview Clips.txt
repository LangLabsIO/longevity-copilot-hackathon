[Laughter] [Music] [Music] so yeah we we were really i guess blessed and lucky is the way to put it that nature magazine put us on the cover it doesn't happen uh to most scientists and if it happens it's uh you know it's one of those uh golden globe award raymond on the wall yeah yeah yeah and we had that happen this december it was a picture of an eyeball being rejuvenated and it was the title was turning back time in the book i talk about what it was like to make a discovery that i think is is an extremely important one if i'm able to say so uh without sounding too pompous my student uh one chenglu who i think will go on to do great things he managed to figure out that there was a a way to remove the scratches on the dvd and reset the age of a highly complex tissue in the mouse which is the eyeball and so we took some mice we gave them glaucoma which is one of the leading causes of blindness or we just let them grow old naturally and then we gave them this gene therapy these three genes that are normally turned on when mice and we are very very young even in utero and what happened was remarkable the cells went back in age their scratches their epigenetic clock went in reverse and the mice got their eyesight back and uh in the case of glaucoma we've now improved on the method they get their eyesight back fully as though they were young and not untreated undamaged and then uh in the old age their eyesight came back fully as well so what does that say that that's a big deal i mean not just for people who need to have their eyes treated but it's a big deal because what it shows is for really for the first time that there's a reset switch in the body where you can go back to being young again uh very rapidly within a matter of a week or two and this isn't just a temporary reset we think this is a permanent age reset and it opens up the possibility that we could treat other organs uh you can just imagine what would happen if we could turn back the age of the brain or the heart the skin the liver uh and perhaps one day full body rejuvenation uh we hope to treat the first human patient with glaucoma in less than two years from now we've been working on that um yeah so that that's where my entrepreneurial experience comes in we don't wait for uh for that but just to finish the point which i think you raised that's important is in my book i talked about this discovery uh and that that was uh 18 months before the s the science world learned about this which is fun and exciting to me that finally the public can hear directly from scientists and in this case hear about it a lot earlier than the illuminati would and did having cured blindness uh we're now moving on to other disabilities and we're now working on curing uh hearing loss deafness which is something of course you know these two things historically were impossible and now we're doing on a routine basis admittedly in mice but you know vision and hearing um they're not too different than what happens in our bodies and i'm quite optimistic either as are my collaborators in the field who are experts on this that this should translate uh into human uh therapies if all goes well you know there's a ways to go i have to say you know please don't get too excited just yet because there's some safety things we have to figure out but the good news is when we reset the eyeball of the mice or even reset many of the organs in a mouse we didn't see any evidence of any downsides you know you might think well there's got to be a downside sounds too good to be true but and and maybe maybe it causes cancer well we haven't seen any evidence of that it seems like when you polish those scratches this the it goes to a certain level and stops you don't keep polishing until you rub off the information too much and that's great news if that's possible then the sky's the limit it's similar to the wright brothers uh you know you they knew they could fly how soon they could the world could have boeing 747s you know they didn't know but they knew that it would happen one day [Music] [Music] [Music] you
