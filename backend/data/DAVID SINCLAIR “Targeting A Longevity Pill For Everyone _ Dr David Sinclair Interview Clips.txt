[Music] so [Music] as well let's say we get to the point where we're able to reset reset every anyone's entire epi genome let's say um who and but there's only limited number of people who who that who can get that that service is not you know democratized how does society decide who is worthy of getting a longer next and we're not talking about just a little bit of a longer life what if we get to the point where you know you know there's like two classes of humans there are those that are destined you know to kind of live to 80 100 and those that are gonna live to a thousand you know what when we think about a thousand years from now when we have if we have these two classes of humans if it's not completely democratized um you know this just raises lots of ethical issues i'm sure you've thought you've thought about this a bit and just wanting some of your thoughts on this yeah well every day i think about this there's no way i'm going to let that happen no way it's not going to be the future i was talking to a movie producer yesterday about making a movie about that it'll stay as science fiction if i have anything to say about it now the treatments often new technologies cost more the wright brothers flying in a plane used to be much more expensive and for the elite going in a rocket of course is you need a lot of money but the idea is to bring the cost down um and that's what i'm going to do we're working now in my lab to take what is currently a gene therapy to reverse aging to make it into a pill that might cost a few cents a day and you give that to somebody for a month they go back five years give it to another couple of months ago back 10 years and we actually now know that at least in mouse experiments that that does reset the body you don't need more treatment and then you just age out again and then eventually you'll just rinse and repeat and keep cycling back and we don't know how many cycles you can do but hopefully it's hundreds we'll see we also are excited that actually just today we got great data that showed that uh any concerns about safety uh were were not valid and so we're pushing forward quickly and safely as best we can into treating humans in the next couple of years we're going to be treating some animals just to make sure some extra safety we have to do that the government requires it of course what about the two classes um so you know i want to bring the cost down to where everybody on the planet can afford it there's a drug called metformin which is given to diabetics which only i do take that yes because there's a lot of evidence from looking at tens of thousands of diabetics who have taken this drug that it's very very safe and that it seems to protect susceptible people from cancer heart disease frailty and alzheimer's disease so for a few cents a day that's for something that has almost no risk hey it's a no-brainer in my book but a lot of physicians most physicians are hesitant to prescribe a drug so type 2 diabetes to someone like me who doesn't yet have type 2 diabetes that's another story but i think that that's the wrong way to view medicine but when it comes to the two societies it could happen if the gene therapy is the only treatment that becomes available because the gene therapies are expensive there's no denying that but what's exciting to tell you about is that there are hundreds of labs so we're now working on what we've just discovered the ability to reverse aging by reprogramming the epigenome somebody is going to make a breakthrough and it's going to become very cheap to reprogram the body and hopefully very safe as well so i'm not worried about that dystopian future um it's very unlikely that it's going to stay expensive for long i'm just trying to think through all the psychological implications as well you know a big part of people's meaning in life is their ability to struggle and their ability to overcome struggle i i see that they're on the horizon maybe some pills that will mimic fasting and the kind of benefits of that will there be pills someday that mimic exercise like are we going to make really lazy humans that live a thousand but have no meaning in their lives anymore we have a pill that lets you learn everything immediately i'm sure you think about this too do we we don't want to strip too much of uh of what it means to be human you know yeah yeah you're right we do need some adversity and actually right now the best way to live a long time is to give your body some adversity that's what exercise and being a bit hungry during the day is all about but can we mimic that in a pill well i believe we already are i'm taking the nmn molecule which in mice literally mimicked exercise those mice were running on treadmill because they were physically fit without having exercised before i'm extremely fit on a treadmill and i don't do a lot of exercise so you know at least based on an n of one experiment which is not valid uh and some friends of mine who do run marathons who have seen at least uh these anecdotal changes in their body in their time run times that this we could already be there to have these exercise uh pills so let's say we do have that what does that mean well it doesn't mean it's an excuse to just sit on a couch and eat potato chips and watch movies because if you want the best bang for the buck so we know this from the mouth from the mouse experiments if you run those mice that also get the pill or the the water with the molecule they run even further those were the ones that that broke the machine uh we we had a treadmill that stopped running in our lab because they just kept running their software wasn't written for mice to ever run more than three kilometers yeah so yeah it's not an excuse um you know i wouldn't mind not having to exercise so much it is painful to do that what i thought you were going to get to scott was if you're going to live a long time does that take the meaning out of life it's totally against what i believe in i do not think that the agency of life and the enjoyment of life has much to do with how many years you have just the mere knowledge that it's finite is sufficient let's use an example and i'll turn the question over to you if you could live 200 years would you be sitting here enjoying this conversation no i really i i think that if you waved a magic wand or you like and you're like scott i just reset your whole happy genome i think i actually would be more motivated and excited to do as much as i possibly can in my life um because that means that i would have double the potential capacity to make an impact on the world it actually would affect my psychology it would affect my psychology i think about this all the time because i think a big part of sometimes i get sad and i and and not depression level but i really do kind of feel unmotivated and sad some some moments because there's such a bittersweet nature to the briefness of it and it's so hard for me to decide you know out of all the choices that i can make in a day you know it can be overwhelming to be like which choices do i make in this short short life for a living that are going to have the biggest impact it's too much stress it would it would alleviate that stress to a certain degree yeah but you and i are are not normal individuals there are plenty of people who have extremely tough lives and have gone into careers uh that are unfulfilling or difficult even painful brutal so what i would i've said that there should be something called a skilled article where everybody gets paid to retrain for two or three years and if life is that long you can do that many times and if you get into the wrong career or you're born into poverty and couldn't get out the first 30 40 50 years you have a chance at another life and everybody should be given a chance to do what they love and find a purpose [Music] [Music] you
