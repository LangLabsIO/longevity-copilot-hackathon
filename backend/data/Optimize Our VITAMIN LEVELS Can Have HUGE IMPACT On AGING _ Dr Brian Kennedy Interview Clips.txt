[Music] one thing we've learned and i i just want to you know it's worth mentioning this that there's a lot of products out there that you get a pill and it says it has 15 things in it first of all if it's this size i mean the akg pill that we give is this size and all it has is akg and a vitamin in it and we didn't make it that big because we wanted to we had it had to be that big to get the ingredients in it if it's this big and it has 15 things in it you have to think about how much of each of those things is actually in that pill um but anyway we've gone back and we've in mice we've done a lot of combinations of different natural products and the one thing i'll say is that i can't predict what's going to synergize what sometimes we see things cancel each other out sometimes we see no big effect and so um i don't think we have much knowledge yet in terms of combining different interventions and if if i can't make reasonable predictions in a a mouse for what works then then i i don't think anybody can give it at this point uh the other thing is that it's not just which intervention for which person is how much and so let me give you an example we have a paper we're going to publish with vitamin a and what we found is that with vitamin a with the first vitamin vitamin a is a natural product and everybody says oh that's safe but it's actually not that safe if you take too much vitamin a it accumulates it can cause toxicity and so the first time we did the mouth study we started 18 months and we gave too much and you're right and we reconfirmed that it definitely causes taxes yeah and then we try to lower we actually what i did is i did the same amount because we were seeing some potential benefits to frailty even though the animals were dying so i did the same amount for four months and stopped and then what we found is that 20 percent of the mice still had the toxicity and diet early the other 80 percent lived 20 percent longer than controls so now we're trying to use uh ai to optimize the amount of vitamin a for each animal so we look at blood markers and try to try to look at toxicity and efficacy markers and try to optimize in each animal because i think we can have a really big effect and and this is this is going back you know it gets back to the vitamin question you know everybody says oh the meta-analysis shows vitamins don't work how many of those studies did anybody actually measure the vitamin levels in the body of the people they were testing almost none and so i i think i i certainly believe there's an optimal range for these vitamins uh and that it is important but unless you measure the individual you don't know how much to give them of a supplemental of a vitamin so you know i think that i think we could take just vitamins and if we did this right and controlled it properly we could probably have a huge impact on aging but it's going to take different levels in in each person in terms of a supplement and we have to figure out how to do that uh so that's the first personalization type thing we're doing and then of course as we start to accumulate human data with interventions we'll hopefully be able to link efficacy for a particular intervention to traits of the people that are being tested i would i would be not at all surprised if some interventions work in females and not males or vice versa because that's true in all the mouse studies but beyond that we might see that you know people that that have certain traits like smoking don't respond to this or they do respond to that so you know i but we have to have a lot of data to really start to draw those conclusions and so hopefully we could like as as more and more people are doing these kinds of study we can find some way to compare each other's data because we have to get the numbers beyond you know 50 per study if we're going to do make those kinds of discoveries [Music] foreign
