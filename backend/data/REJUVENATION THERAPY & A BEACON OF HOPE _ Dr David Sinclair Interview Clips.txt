[Music] just want to just have a glimpse into what the future might look like i told you we can we have a gene therapy that can reverse aging in a mouse's eye but what if it works in people what if it works in the whole body to reset the age of somebody i just chose bill murray um because i like bill murray but you know he's he's aged right like everybody but imagine if if when we're young we get this injection of the gene therapy so now we're genetically modified but the genes are not turned on yet they're just like in our mice they're switched off they're not doing any harm and then you get to this age i don't know how old is bill murray now would he be 60 or something maybe even more anyway you get you get to a certain age and your doctor says i've just measured your biological age you're actually 85 you're not doing so well mr sinclair but i've got something for you fortunately you've got these three yamanaka factors in your body i'll give you a course of doxycycline to turn on the genes so you get sent home with basically an antibiotic for lyme disease not not a problem take it for three weeks and imagine you know you start to see better you don't have to see them hold the menu so far away you can think better you fit and you even look younger that's the kind of future that this technology says could be possible and then i just want to give you an example this is uh exhibit a in my family we are a group of least on my hungarian side a group of ashkenazi jews that uh changed their religion in world war ii but we couldn't change our genetics we have terrible genes uh you probably know ashkenazis are not the healthiest people on the planet and i'm carrying a bunch of mutations so i'm not predicted to live a long time in fact most men in our family die in their 70s my grandmother had a stroke in her 30s super high cholesterol right i'm on i'm on huge amounts of uh of lipitor just to keep my cholesterol down so we are not a healthy bunch so my grandmother she became she was she remember she was a young at heart vivacious woman rebel i watched her get old at age 70 she didn't want to go out of the house and she spent 20 years basically in a state a vegetative kind of state that is something that a lot of people expect in their lives it's pretty normal for us to spend 10 years not wanting to live anymore her son my father was born 1939 uh yeah people always get confused about those dates that how can they be so close but i've told you i think she was pregnant at 14 but in any case my dad he wasn't expecting to live beyond 70 in a healthy way just like his mom he retired at 67 he thought that he would probably end up in a wheelchair like his gran his mom and uh he wasn't very happy he was a quite a depressed guy he's like uh winnie the pooh in uh i was not so he's like eeyore in winnie the pooh so he's not a very um optimistic guy if if he was here he'd probably say oh you know the temperature's not very good and and why are we wasting our time we're all going to die anyway that kind of attitude in life and i was there like no no this is great we can do this so anyway he's a scientist he was a bike is a biochemist and he saw the research and he saw that i was still alive after taking a few of these things and he decided to take it as well so he's been now on the same regimen as me um not just those three things but a few other things as well including a lot of exercise don't get me wrong there's other things going on but i'll tell you what he's um he's now 80. uh he started us a new career he's gone back to work he just ordered his dream car uh he just got it last week at tesla model 3 and he's optimistic i can't believe it i mean he's looking forward to another 10 20 years of life so i'm not saying that this is proof of anything but i am holding him up as a role model a beacon of hope for us and i'll show you some photos from the last 12 months of his life right this is not a typical 80 year old he's doing everything he always wanted we just got back here he is he led the way up the rain forest in uganda he took his five grandkids up to see the gorillas and it it almost brings a tear to my eye to think about how special that day was that he got to do that with his grandkids and my my kids got to do that with their grandfather that's what this is all about this isn't about us living forever it's about spending quality time with your family instead of being in a nursing home so we're very proud of of him we hope he continues we hope it goes well [Music] you
