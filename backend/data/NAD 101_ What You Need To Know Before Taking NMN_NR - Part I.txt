[Music] foreign so first of all what I'm going to do is I'm just going to take you through NAD precursors because if you're familiar with the concept of boosting NAD then you'll have definitely come across the term NAD precursors and basically an NAD precursor is just the raw material that the body uses to make NAD and there are five precursors that the body can use to make NAD there is the amino acid tryptophan there's nicotinic acid nicotinamide which is commonly abbreviated as Nam which you'll see in my presentation nicotinamide riboside or NR are nicotinamide mononucleotides or nmn so the body can use all of these different precursors to make NAD so because the Salvage pathway is the main way that the body produces NAD I'm just going to explain how the Salvage pathway Works in a little bit more detail so basically you've got precursors here that I've just described these enter the pathway and then they are converted by enzymatic processes into NAD then this NAD is then used up in the cell so you've got the sirtuins the parp DNA repair enzyme cd38 all of these things are using up NAD and when they use it up they actually break it down back into the precursor nicotinamide now in a young healthy cell what happens is this nicotinamide is then effectively recycled back through this process into fresh NAD again it doesn't need any fresh precursor to come in from outside the system it basically just gets recycled straight back into NAD and the important part in this pathway that does it is an enzyme up here called nampt now this enzyme is really important because it's what we refer to as a rate limit in enzyme which basically means that if the levels of this enzyme are directly linked to actually how much NAD is going to produce so if the levels of this enzyme go down it's bad because NAD will not be produced as effectively as we age what happens is our cells are using more energy than they can make a recycle it means there's a deficit and the repair and maintenance processes down here in the cell that are actually dependent on NAD they have to fight over a limited supply of NAD this ultimately leads to damage and then to some signs and symptoms of Aging if we go back to the little diagram here what happens if you just use a supplement such as NR or nmn a precursor based supplement the precursor goes into the cell it does get converted into NAD which is why you see um companies that produce these um molecules show around a 60 increase in NAD boost with these supplements so you do get an increase in NAD but this NAD is then used up and it's broken down and as soon as it's broken down it's converted into nicotinamide and if you haven't fixed the underlying problems in the cell which are causing NAD to decline namely this reduction in the Salvage pathway because of this enzyme that's declined with age what happens is the cell has to get rid of it so it methylates it and it excretes it then if you just continue pumping more NR or more nmn in the system without trying to fix the Salvage pathway you just keep contributing to the problem because you your cells are using up this initial boost of NAD but it's getting converted into nicotinamide and then the nicotinamide has to get out of the cell so you get methyl donor depletion and this is why many practitioners will say to the clients you need to use um trimethyl glycine or something like that to get to actually stop these negative effects because a depletion in methyl groups is actually really bad for epigenetics because it's very important for altering the structure of your DNA [Music] number
