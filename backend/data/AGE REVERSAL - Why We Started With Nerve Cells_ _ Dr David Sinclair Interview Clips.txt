[Music] i wanted to tell you about why we chose the nervous system to regenerate to reverse aging in because we could have chosen the skin could have chosen the liver to reverse aging but nerve cells become old very quickly as soon as we're you know three years old if we damage our eye or we break our back our spine we're not going to walk again we're not going to see again we know that right it's because nerve cells become old very quickly and they don't act like they were when we were embryos and so this shows an embryonic nerve growing in the dish that's great but as we're as we turn into adults if you put one of our nerves in a dish it'll just sit there it'll try its best to try and grow but it really won't grow very well so we thought what if you could take adult nerve cells damage them or even just old nerve cells in the eye and turn their age back to when they were young would they grow and function like they were young again so how did we decide to do that well there was a nobel prize awarded to shinya yamanaka from japan for the discovery that there are a set of four genes called the yamanaka factors that can take an adult cell and turn it into a stem cell so quite simply any high school student could take one of your skin cells in your mouth take it back to my lab or even to the high school lab put in these four genes from yamanaka which we call osk and m for short and those cells many of them would become stem cells not just normal stem cells but pluripotent stem cells meaning they could become any type you want we could regrow we could grow a little mini brain in the dish you can now do that it's pretty freaky will grow your own mini brain in the dish i don't think they're conscious thank goodness but we could build any tissue and that that was well worthy of a nobel prize right so we wondered could we use some aspect of this discovery to reverse aging so we don't want to take them all the way back to being an embryo or to a stem cell you know if we did that we'd all end up with the world's biggest tumors in our bodies we wanted to know if we could do partial reversal and just take off the right methyls pick off just the right plaque on the teeth without taking all your teeth off which is what yamanaka did so we didn't know if it would work we had some clue because there's a scientist at the salk institute that a couple of years ago showed that if you turn on all four of these genes in a mouse it lives 40 percent longer but that but that sounds great until i tell you that every three days if they didn't stop the treatment the mice would die so that i think he may get the nobel prize for this discovery but it wasn't perfect because those poor mice were hit with these factors and they would almost die and then they'd let them recover for another five days and they'd hit them again this is not going to be a medicine anytime soon but it sure is an interesting proof of principle that you can turn on these things and make an animal live longer now it was a short-lived mouse so we still have to show that this happens in a a regular mouse but i'll show you what happens in regular mice when you when you put these factors in right so what i'm i'm showing you for the first time is what it was like to make a discovery of a lifetime this was the discovery of my lifetime these are conversations with my student ryan who made this discovery he put the yamanaka factors not all four of them he found that three were safe and effective the you know the one at the end of m mick he left that off because that causes cancer that's known to be a problem but osk put into the back of the eye regenerated the the optic nerve in these mice and so what you're seeing are pictures for the first time that he was sending me of regenerating optic nerves in mice so we had damaged the back of the eye and here we have it the regrowth of something that should has no business regrowing in an adult mouse but it's it was you know one of those things where you know we're kind of celebrating that we've we've made a big discovery and i mention it also because when you read the book you'll get a sense of what it was like to experience such a discovery so this is it this is a regular optic nerve that's been damaged it's been pinched and the nerves have died off towards the brain so the brain is out that way and the eye is over here and this mouse has lost a lot of its nerves and it's never going to see again but in this mouse in the in the mouse i'll show you down here we've reprogrammed its eye to be young again we've put those three yamanaka factors in turn them on with just an antibiotic called doxycycline now it doesn't have to be an antibiotic sometimes people say what's so good about the antibiotic we've just engineered the system so that the antibiotic is the switch so that we can turn it on and off it's an easy way you just give the mice an injection of antibiotic or put in their water supply so if we ever have a drug like this it may be that we get treated with the the virus which is the delivery vehicle and then we take an antibiotic to turn it on and off at will so we get reset multiple times anyway let me show you this this was the result that most of the nerves here have survived the problem and they started to grow towards the brain we don't know how they know where the brain is they're not growing up that way they're growing towards the brain that's a mystery but then we did a really cool experiment which was if it can make these damaged neurons survive what about if we give it to just regular healthy but old mice what happens to their vision and i don't know about you but you know i'm now in my 50s and i'm starting to become like old mice we lose our ability to see so here's an experiment and i need to give credit to um the lab of bruce and meredith cassandra they are at a mass eye near here in boston and what they do is they ignore ignore the feces this is irrelevant to the experiment i think if if we were handled by giant things we'd be pretty upset too but anyway what they're doing is so he's standing on the platform and this mouse is a year old so those mice actually have become blind and you we know this because when these these lines move they don't watch the lines it's called the optomotor response so if i play this for you you'll see um that it's not moving its head it's really not not looking anywhere and we can videotape this for from you know half an hour it's not going to see the lines but you know if we see moving lines we're going to move our head that's just the natural response so we took mice of the same age we gave them a virus that carried the three genes into the eye and the virus infected the nerves at the back of the eye in the retina and they sat there until we gave them the antibiotic antibiotic toxic cycling to turn on those genes three weeks later after reprogramming their eyes and making them young again and by the way we've measured the age of the eye they do get younger based on the clock the question was does it work or does the clock change but that's just like a clock on the wall you don't really go back in time if you move the hands or if you move the hands does time really go backwards so this was a really good experiment and it was a really good day for bruce so what bruce called me about let me get this started so it was 10 p.m at night it was about a year ago and he calls me and he says i'm sorry it's late but i have to tell you we just had a really amazing result and this was the video that he sent me for the first time in history we've got mice that have been cured of blindness that's a mouse that can see and we've done this on dozens of mice this isn't just a fluke every mouse that gets our treatment gets their vision back and we can measure the the neuronal activity at the back of the eye and we can see that those nerves before the treatment have no electrical activity but after reprogramming them we get the blips back they work again and we can read the pattern of genes which are switched on and off and genes that went off during aging come back on with treatment and genes that went on by accident the scratches come back to normal so we're truly resetting the epigenome so that cells can be young again and mice that shouldn't be seeing can see again and we've done this also in glaucoma most people have somebody they know friends or family with glaucoma pressure in the eye damaging the retina we've tested mice with that disease and we can restore their vision as well so our first drug if all goes well will be a drug to treat and restore vision in glaucoma patients [Music] you
