so [Music] you you you actually seen it with your own eyes that in a week's time someone's skin can rejuvenate and be rebinded rewind it back into like a young age i i wish that were true um no we can rewind skin cells that we grow uh and we're now doing what are called skin organoids uh which are models for skin and then we'll move on if that all works to turning back the clock in the skin as well right now that happens yeah well we need to figure out a better way of doing it right now it's a gene therapy and i think a gene therapy for beauty would be extreme but the biological principles are still there that the body has a memory of youth that we can tap into by turning on a combination of just three genes and it should be possible to do that with uh small molecules that you could put into a cream one day wonderful i hope it happens before i get a lot of wrinkles everybody would be i put up on my instagram and i was like hey i'm going to talk to him you know uh one of the uh the the front runners as far as uh anti-aging and aging in general what questions you have and you might not be surprised by this question the number one question that came back was from a lot of women and it said what to put on their faces to to remove lines i have a feeling i know your answer is going to be around this it probably has something to do with besides just putting something on your face but with the look of aging what uh what helps with that uh yeah well so i i have a fair number of uh of vip clients who are asking me these same questions the good news is that if you do what i what i do um probably what's happening is your whole body will will stay healthier and younger and your skin is a very large organ if not the largest so you can start on the inside you don't need to slather yourself with stuff um i don't know you can judge me i'm 51 so i haven't got a gray hair yet um and i don't think i've lost much either so you know that's what we call an n of one clinical trial not exactly helpful but i do believe that you should start on the inside and you can apply things from the outside there are i mean the easiest thing to do is just avoid the sun i grew up in australia unfortunately when it was fashionable to get burnt that's going to come back to haunt me so avoid avoid the sun take vitamin d that's also very good long term for health and the skin [Music] there's uh retinol which actually does work i would say that's something that a lot of people already know uh there are creams that are purported to raise nad levels nad is a molecule we work on in my lab and that's the fuel for these sirtuins that i've talked about these longevity genes and actually actually as we get older the nad levels in the skin go go down by about twofold so in my 50s i'm 51 as i said i would have roughly half the levels as i did when i was 20. so maybe you can raise the levels of an ad in the skin with a cream uh instead i take a pill that raises my nad levels i talk about it in the book page 304 if you want to learn all that stuff um i think it's possible to slow aging in the skin um you know and then it if that doesn't work there's always uh the other cosmetic stuff but uh you know i think you want to start early in life you know once you're in your 30s when i when i started it's a long-term program you cannot expect to start at 45 and instantly reverse the effects yeah i had a feeling you're going to say it started from the inside out there's not a whole lot of magic effects that actually takes but people want the fix all they want they just want to fix it and look young immediately but um i'm curious with with that in in with skin in general um what do you know about red light therapy uh around the skin and producing mitochondria as well yeah i i think it's got legs as a scientist i tried to extend the lifespan of nematode worms with this red light in my lab it didn't work but i haven't given up given up on it yet um i think there's something to the red light therapy there's some reasonable data on uh what is it hair growth uh from this so probably there's something going on but it's really not well studied we need a lot more i've seen that you can buy these red lights um someone even sent me one to be honest i haven't used it much but i think that there's there's good reason to think that certain wavelengths could trigger your body into a hormesis effect um yeah i think where i stand on that is we need more research but i doubt that it's doing harm right so i'm curious because you said something i want to get really clear on it you said avoid the sun now do you mean completely avoid the sun or do you mean you know avoid getting burned because a lot of people are to be like he said don't go out so i'm not going to go out yeah but i've also heard that being having at least some sunlight triggers you know turns off like between turns on or off like 300 switches inside of your brain in your body and all this stuff so so with sunlight and getting the vitamin d from sunlight but also taking it um as you recommended um what is what is your recommendation around sunlight yeah well disclaimer i don't recommend stuff but what i can tell you is that no recommendations what does the science say around sunlight yeah thank you rob thanks for bringing that up maybe i i misspoke what i meant to say was don't stay in the sun long enough for there to be irreversible damage so a little bit of sunlight is good i walk out i haven't been out that much because it's middle of winter here in boston but yeah some sunshine is fine but but don't do it for you know more it depends on the uv but i would these days because i'm you know pasty as much as a vampire would be i would i don't want to spend more than half an hour out there in the sun that's enough but think of it as a competition between dna damage what's happening with the sunlight is your dna gets crosslinked and your body has to come in and take out those crosslinks and put a new piece of dna in and your body takes time to do that and the older you get the worse it get the the slower it is and it's a balance of damage repair damage repair and if you don't repair it you get mutations and epigenetic changes too don't forget so what i like to do is i you know get a bit of sun it's healthy for sure you get a bit of a tanning effect too but if you stay red you've overdone it uh your body can't cope and it's got inflammation so you're limited but you know i wasn't trying to say live in your basement for the rest of your life i'm eager to get out this pandemic has been pretty uh harsh on myself and all of us [Music] [Applause] you
