[Music] i'm working on pharmaceuticals as well life biosciences is a company that has three programs that work on three different aspects of aging uh one i i hope is going to be a solution to obesity as well as longevity there's one that works on proteins that get old and reversing that destroying them uh and that will be useful for aging but also alzheimer's disease and other age-related issues with the eye and this is all the also the company that is developing the vision restoration uh metro biotech is developing nad-based pharmaceuticals there's a lot of talk about nad on the web uh you're welcome to check that out but i don't sell supplements i'm developing pharmaceuticals so that's this company and we've been in human clinical trials for the last two years with uh promising results that i hope to talk about later uh how do you measure the epigenome structure uh so fortunately there have been some breakthroughs and this is a company that i'm on the board of and have grown since the beginning this is this supplies kits to researchers and and hospitals around the world to be able to measure your genome your epigenome in three dimensions it's called dovetail genomics um and i also unfortunately uh well i don't know if it's unfortunate but i did talk about the pandemic coming in lifespan and this was back in 2019 and uh it happened of course but what it did was it because i knew it was coming at some point i started developing a company that can measure infections partly it was you if you read the book or have read the book you know that our daughter natalie our middle daughter developed lying or caught lyme disease and the test for lyme disease is is pretty useless and slow it was not useless but it's definitely slow and sometimes fails so what i decided to do is start a company out of my lab it's called arc bio we uh use we built our own computers in my garage actually to run this and now we can take any sample of your body and tell you what's non-human and this is i believe is the future of microbiology and disease detection right now this is a this company is using a technology to look at viruses in the human body and particularly in transplant patients where it's a problem there's been this revolution in the science of aging there are already a couple of nobel prizes awarded for work that is relevant to asian um there may be more uh but in terms of the the world's view governments are paying attention to this investors are piling in right now it's it's a massive growth industry and it's my my prediction or my view that uh you know we'll look back at the 21st century and say this was a real turning point um you know we've been very excited by these devices for the last 10 or so years even more but uh you know i think the revolution that's coming is gonna you know far outweigh uh in terms of human history and importance and money made than anything we've seen recently i see no reason why we sh why we would address cancer and heart disease and alzheimer's to keep people hopefully healthier for a bit longer but ignore the main cause of all of those diseases which is our cells get old and you know i don't buy the argument that it's natural i don't buy the argument that oh it's it's it's too scary to work on or it's god's gift or it'll make life less meaningful all of that that sounds like complete bull to me the kind of thing that people would have said a hundred years ago about antibiotics so instead i think that people just find it uncomfortable talking about aging because it's new but already in my circles and soon globally in the next 10 years it'll be a normal topic of conversation and everyone will wonder why we didn't work on this earlier [Music] you
