[Music] foreign another concept that I want to introduce if you're not familiar with it is the concept of information transmission and Storage and this uh fellow up here was a professor Claude Shannon he was at MIT during the 1940s and spent much of his career trying to figure out how to transmit radio signals without it being lost along the way which of course can cost lives in as they did in World War II so he came up with a mathematical theory of communication and it basically led to the internet that we use today and what he he said in this diagram this is pulled straight out of his at least the black part is pulled straight out of his paper from 1948. he said that you can have a transmitter and a receiver and there will always be noise whether it's background radiation or something uh but the problem is how do you have a perfect transmission and he proposed that there would be this Observer We Now call The Observer the backup copy or the TCP protocol of the internet but he was the first to show mathematically at least that you could use a backup copy to reconstitute the original message and this is why we can no longer use the excuse that oh I didn't get your email it always arrives unfortunately um but what I've done is I've added a concept of biology as I'm thinking about it currently and that is that information either genetic or epigenetic uh is in a relatively pristine State when we're very young and over time you have you have uh aging and what might be happening is that you lose information whether it's genetic or epigenetic and we don't know that what that is yet for sure especially the epigenetic component um and perhaps is there insoles a reset switch can did cells ever store a more youthful version of their uh gene expression pattern say or their younger identity and if they do wouldn't it be amazing because then we could potentially tap into that and as I show in this example of the eye uh reboot the system and get those cells to function like they were young again so this is where we've been headed lately foreign [Music]
