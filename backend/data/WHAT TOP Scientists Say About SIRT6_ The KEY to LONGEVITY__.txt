[Music] the 36 seems to be the most potent slash important because when you turn it on or give extra copies in mice you get a robust lifespan extension the 36 is exciting we've we're working on molecules that activate so T6 and if we could activate 36 we could improve metabolism down regulate hyperinflammation and even treat cancer and we found out that there's some proteins in your body whose levels start off really high when you're really young and they just drop down over time and if you eat poorly and don't exercise and do all the bad things they drop down faster we're working on a gene I'm in a very cool company actually a lot of the work came out of Barry lawn University heimcohen right at right here and he figured out that a protein called cert6 is probably the top longevity Gene right now meaning you get more of it you live longer not always true but interestingly mice which live only two years they have a little bit of it and it doesn't last very long humans have a lot of it we live for a long time and the probably sad mixed blessing thing about this is if you give it to a mouse who's taking McDonald's diet or Wendy's diet every night and their their blood looks like the blood there with the white stuff in it that's fat on the top of the blood that shouldn't be there and you give them this protein then you don't get the problem so more search six keeps your body happy even when you're eating McDonald's it's probably we should go talk to McDonald's I I should tell you from this science perspective I come from the science you know I have these centenarian study we have 750 centinarians and their families and we found functional mutation in in the 36th Gene that for me completed this story from mice to humans and it's very important because if you have let's put it this way the F two-thirds of the drugs that FDA approved last year or 2021 actually on 21 two-thirds of the drug were based or supported by the by genetic discoveries in humans we assume too much from Mice from Young mice in our previous drug development and failed too often so so this is another reason why I think that this is going to be very relevant to humans and probably within this audience I'm the only ones that was able to extend lifespan by 30 percent I did it to mice but hopefully I was planning to do it in human and take whatever we found in Mars into human therapy Celtics is involving many activities within the cells many of this that I'm going to share we were involved in finding them for example it's involved in DNA repair in glucose metabolism and by regulating glucose metabolisms prevent or block cancer at the stomach suppressor because it's a blocks the devil book effect it's involving that jurisdiction we showed that under that restriction or calorie restrictions that extend lifespan the lesson the level of 36 increase it's involved in maintenance maintaining your telomere lengths to prevent inflammation also in embryonic development if you having a homozygic mutation for 36 it's embryonic little inhuman in monkeys you die two hours after birth in mice when you don't have 36 you develop premature aging phenotype you die very early after four four weeks what we've been trying to do is use the genetics of centenarians to identify what we call rare variants so these are mutations per se but they're changes in the genomes of the centenarians that keep them healthier for longer so if you look at centenarians how long they are disease free so they live longer but they're disease free for longer and if you look at the cost of of Health Care at the end of a life of a centenarian it's minuscule compared to those of us who aren't going to be centenarians so they don't go to the hospital they really don't need medical care they die in their sleep at 110 which is the way we all would like to go when they're in their health less Alzheimer's less cancer and what's intriguing so far is it's not that they have a lack of bad genes so some of these centenarians actually have uh mutations in cancer genes broca-1 mutations apoe that may increase your risk of Alzheimer's they have things that may increase through their risk of diabetes but they don't get these diseases so it appears they have variants that can offset the bad genes so it's not the lack of bad genes it's actually they have good genes and so we and others are using the sequence of these centenarians to identify genes and Pathways which we think are important targets and so we've kind of proven this concept near Barcelona use ensue very gorba Nova and others that are really doing the genetics have identified certain genes where their variants either in the regions that regulate their expression so for some of these it means they're expressed at higher levels and centenarians are the ones are expressed at lower levels and then there's some that actually have variants within the protein coding sequence so it changes the function of these in the best example this has been talked about it's not yet published is a sirtuin protein there's seven sirtuins they do important things to regulate metabolism DNA repair a variety of processes and have been linked to lifespan at least several of them have in model organisms and cert6 is the one we've identified the two amino acid variant that improves an enzymatic activity and now we've identified a drug which improves that activity which we're now characterizing in mice to see if that makes the mice healthier through this search sex they have been centenarians at least some have a variant that improves their enzymatic activity of that certain sex protein the advantage here is that if you can prove that that variant really is contributing to lifespan and satinarians which we're doing by putting the variants in the mice it's a validated Target it's validated it's it's something that contributes to keeping humans disease free for longer so it's really an exciting time because we can identify these Pathways when you identify these genes and we can develop drugs that mimic the effect of those variants in centenarians at least that's the goal and we have a couple examples of that today so I think this is going to be in the really an exciting area over the next 10 years foreign [Music]
