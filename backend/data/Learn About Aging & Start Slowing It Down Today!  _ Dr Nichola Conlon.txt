[Music] and today I am going to talk to you about aging but before I start I'm going well I'm going to actually start with a bit of a perhaps controversial quote here which I'm going to make a statement and say that within our lives we will take drugs to actually slow our rate of Aging so I'll I'll just say that again within our lives in this room we will take drugs to actually slow our rate of Aging now why why would I stand on stage in front of all you guys and sort of say something so crazy that is probably a completely new idea for for everyone sitting here because it does sound kind of crazy to have this pill that you could take to slow aging but the truth is this is actually what I do this is actually my job so I'm a scientist and I specialize in the science of Aging or more specifically Al the science of why we age at a cellular level and why we actually start to get sicker as we get older and why we come become more frail and generally start to fall apart a bit as we get older and that is what I've done for the last seven years I have worked in drug development actually developing drugs and supplements and topicals that will actually slow the rate at which our cells age so I know what you're thinking okay we've heard this all before absolute snake oil rubbish we've heard of magic Lo and potions that you know give us all this promise but don't actually work and I have to be completely honest if somebody had come on stage and told me 10 years ago even though I'm a scientist that we'd be able to slow our rate of age in I would have said exactly the same thing because you know you can't you know that's what I would have thought but the truth is there's actually been some huge developments within our fields in the last 10 years that have not only let us understand like why we are actually aging but also that aging isn't this fixed thing just as we know we can speed up aging we now know that we can actually slow down aging as well and this is what I'm going to talk to you all about but first of all agent this word okay what does it actually mean like if you think about it how would you actually Define it and it it kind of gets a bit difficult because it kind of depends who you ask because I guess if you ask a child you know you'd probably go oh I want to get older I want to grow grow up it sounds like this great thing to get a bit older however if you ask someone that's maybe 49 they might not be so optimistic about putting that extra Candle on the birthday cake uh you know so it's it's kind of a hard thing but when you get when you get when you say to people but what is it like what is happening people start to go well you know it's this inevitable thing it's this natural thing that you just can't stop it's the march of time you kind of get a bit of a wishy-washy definition you know it's hard to put a real point on but what is act what what is actually aging what is it so because I'm a scientist I like to explain what aging is in scientific terms so scientifically what is actually going on within our bodies that is actually causing aging or the signs and symptoms that we associate with agent to actually happen so we're going to do a bit of a science lesson okay so bear with me here so your life purpose is to pass on your DNA so I'm really sorry for everyone who thought the life purpose was to be an artist or a scientist or a doctor or whatever it's actually not at least in evolutionary terms your life purpose is to carry your DNA and pass it on to your children essentially so our bodies are kind of like designed as a bit of a shell to protect our DNA to make sure that we get to reproductive age and we can pass on our DNA in one piece but the problem is that life is actually really destructive so every day things are trying to damage our bodies and damage our DNA so you've got you know just by breathing you're actually damaging your DNA DNA CU you get free radicals which are hitting it and damaging it all the time then you've got things that we inflict upon ourselves like poor diet and and things like that so what it means is that our bodies have had to evolve to have some really brilliant self-repair mechanisms and just to put this into perspective every day it's estimated that you get about 10,000 pieces of DNA damage in your cells and your cells are just fixing it continuously without you even knowing about it and even become an issue so they're really really clever at fixing this damage but the problem is to fix this damage it takes a lot of energy for the cells so the body kind of says right up until reproductive age it's kind of worth investing this energy and repairing our cells and actually looking after the body to fulfill the life's purpose but after childbearing age why would the body keep investing all this energy in repairing itself when really it should have done its job by now and passed on that DNA so what happens is after childbearing age all of this repair and maintenance in the cells sort of get switched off and then you get damage and then you get what we see as the signs and symptoms of aging and this is actually called the Disposable Soma Theory of Aging and your Soma is another word for body and it basically means your body's disposable which sounds pretty Grim but in scientific terms that is kind of what agent is but what does this mean for us right well look at this life expectancy graph okay so back in the 1800s here we were really lucky to live till Age 4 you know that was a really good good time to get to and up here we're now living well into our 80s and this has happened over a very short time frame so back in the 1800s here when we were dying just after childbearing age we didn't really experience aging like getting get old age wasn't really a thing because we never really lived in that period of lives after childbearing age where we didn't have all this repair turned on cuz what happened is we died from a tooth absess or in child birth or something like that but now thanks to improved sanitation and healthc care and everything we're now living way way longer and quite frankly our bodies haven't evolved or been designed to actually live this long so we're kind of living a new territory as far as Evolution and biology is concerned so I like to say that we have evolved to be good at being young but not good at being old so as far as Evolution was concerned we were never going to reach old age so why would it make us good at being old so we're now living these long lifespans but we don't have the sort of repair and maintenance systems within ourselves to be able to live them well so these two words the top one you'll be very familiar with but I'm going to teach you a little bit about the bottom one and more importantly the difference between these two things so your lifespan is just the number of years you will live whereas your health span is the number of these years that you will actually live in good health and this is the important one and this is the one you have to remember because what I like to say is your health span is the proportion of your life that you actually living you're not suffering from disease you're you you know you're independent you can basically live your life how you want to live your life and you're not limited the issue that we've really got now is there's a big discrepancy between a lifespan and a health span okay so to put this into perspective for a girl born in the UK today she is expected to live for 83 years that's her lifespan but her health span is currently at current rates only predicted to actually be until 64 so this means 23% of her life or nearly a quarter of her life is expected to be lived in poor health and I think we can all probably see this around us from you know issues in Care Homes and things like this this this is real stats here that we can see happening around us and the reason for this is is because it's very well known now that aging is actually the biggest risk factor for all of the major diseases that we are really suffering all of the things that drugs companies are actually trying to cure the biggest risk factor is actually your age so just to put this into some graphs because I'm a scientist top one cardiovascular disease you know after age 40 it's really starting to go up the middle one here shows dementia if you haven't got it by the time you in your 70s it's probably on its way and the last one here this is cancer I mean look at this just after your 40s 50s post childbearing age your risk just goes up and I'm really sorry because they're not good stats that probably people in this room don't want to be hearing but actually putting on yours is one of the worst things you can actually do for your health now the thing is agent's inevitable isn't it it's this natural process you can't do anything about it you know the way it is this is our life trajectory we're born we learn we earn we retire and then we expire and that's what we just accept is going to happen but what happens if you could actually slow stop or even reverse aging how would that change things how would people feel about that would that mean we could live these longer lifespans that we now have but in good health improve our health span so this is exactly what scientists like myself started to say they said okay let's look at the way we approach agent and a minute and the way we do that is we've got all of these age related diseases we research them all individually and we treat them all individually and quite frankly that isn't working because at current rates we're expected to live for about 20 years in poor health so this really needs to change because it's having a huge socioeconomic impact that we can see all around us and this is only going to get worse so by 2030 one in five people in the UK will be aged 65 and above so in other words out of their period of Health span okay and the more worryingly worrying bit is that the fastest growing po portion of our population at the moment is actually 85 Plus and we all know 85 Plus are going to have multiple health related issues and just looking at agent as a whole the amount of suffering that it actually causes worldwide there are 150,000 deaths per day and of these it's estimated that a 100,000 are actually age related so and we know that people just don't just suddenly drop off the perch from aging this is like years before this of suffering of age related diseases before they actually die and on top of this there's all the things that aren't diseases associated with age and forgetfulness and continence Frailty and they're not even considered in this sort of stats so scientists said well let's look at this completely differently Okay so we've got all of these age related diseases aging is kind of the root cause so therefore aren't these just sympt symptoms of aging and if they are then why don't you treat the root cause and actually treat aging and if you did this would it reduce the onset of age related disease would it actually increase health span and what they have found is that unequivocally AG in can be can be slowed it can actually even be reversed and the most important thing is that both of these things improve health span so the million dooll question how on if do you actually slow AG in now there have actually been found to be nine different ways scientifically that you can actually slow AG in but I don't have time to go through all of those so I'm going to go through one that I'm an expert on and that is a molecule called NAD which stands for nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide but you don't need to remember that all you need to remember is that NAD is an incredibly important molecule that you've probably never heard of but it's so important in your cells that if you didn't have it you would be literally dead in 30 30 seconds and the reason for this is NAD has some really important roles in the body so first of all it's a natural molecule that's found in your body and it's in every single cell and it's incredibly important for cellular energy production so this is taking your food and turning it into the energy that your cells need to actually just do all of their function and all of the processes the other thing that is really important for is cellular repair and we all know how important cellular repair is so NAD when it's high actually switches on cellular maintenance and repair in the cell and also keeps energy levels high now the issue is NAD has been found to decline as we get older and actually quite significantly so it's estimated that your NAD levels in your cell half every 20 years so what this means is by the time you're 20 you've already lost half of this critical molecule that you're born with which is pretty scary considering how important it actually is now if you just look here you remember I was saying after childbearing age your repair and maintenance get Switched Off well it's no coincidence that after age 40 here that your NAD is really low and remember that NAD is what is actually keeping your maintenance and repair switched on which we know get switched off after childbearing age so sinus said okay right we've got this really important molecule here and it's declining with age but it's supposed to be keeping all these good things switched on so what happens if we just don't let it decline with age what happens if we keep it high as we get older or actually in older cells we boost it back up to Youth full levels so this is exactly what they did and many experiments have now demonstrated that by restoring or maintaining NAD levels it has a huge host of benefits everything from improving cell cellular energy levels to repairing and looking after that critical DNA all through to medical type things like improving cognitive function and to actually looking at improved cardiovascular function insulin resistance all of these things that actually decline with age in other words by restoring NAD levels it is actually improving your health span which is what we're all about trying to do so I'm just going to finish Now by going back to that quote I said at the start which was within our lifespans we will actually take drugs to slow our rate of aging and I hope now that you've heard me speak you might not think that's such a crazy idea and that you understand why scientists like myself are actually seriously looking in researching this because there is a huge amount of research that's going on within our field at the moment you only need to Google it to to get a flavor of how big this could possibly be I've just put a a couple of news articles up there that been there recently and this means when all of this comes through within our lifetimes it really is going to change aging as we know it thank [Applause] [Music] you
