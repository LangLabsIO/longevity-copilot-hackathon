[Music] well right now it's it's possible to add genes to humans blind people are seeing again yeah but it's only a small it's it's thousands of people it's not millions yet but we are getting better at it and eventually probably in certainly in this decade uh we'll see people being able to add genes to their bodies more commonly but crispr is different crispr is not adding genes it's actually changing your genetic makeup permanently uh and so where we're at is there are some genes or some studies that have shown that it works in humans you can correct sickle cell anemia and fix that that one's a little easier because it's in the bloodstream trying to fix alzheimer's with crispr is going to be a lot more challenging the blood is easy to access and the way we do it is we put a crispr system which is an enzyme that you can direct to change the dna with a barcode um so our dna has different letters there's six feet of this dna molecule in every cell and there are these four letters actg and they're in different sequence and what crispr does that's kind of incredible if you think about it is that you can give it a code that says go find the sequence that's a t g c a g c and it'll find it in billions of combinations in that six foot and go in and just change that it's a bar code and uh and so i would say in the next five years it'll be fairly common to fix genetic diseases with crispr and then and then things get really interesting when we start to fix things that aren't genetic maybe we want to all fix our predisposition to diabetes we could potentially go in and fix that before we actually get that disease and and make up for not having great genetic probably for the healthy people it's going to take longer right doctors would rather do no harm than be good um and so that's probably 15 years away for from being mainstream there are other technologies one one called si rna which is similar but it actually stops the production of uh protein rather than changing the genes one step down uh and that's being shown and there's a drug on the market to treat high cholesterol and even there's a drug fatty liver and so increasingly we're able to change the genetic code or the codes that are coming off the genetic code which is rna which we all have heard about because of code it's amazing that we can now read the dna and rewrite it uh and it's and in my work we've just recently figured out how to turn on three embryonic genes in the body uh and when we do that in just the right three genes that resets the age of of the tissue and it gets rejuvenated well there are patients already that have had it done but for it to be mainstream 5 to 15 depending on the disease [Music] you
