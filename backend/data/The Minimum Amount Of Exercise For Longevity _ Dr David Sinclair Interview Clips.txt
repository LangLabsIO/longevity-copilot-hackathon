[Music] it says how much exercise is the person actually the average person so what's the minimum amount to create that stress that would be beneficial okay well there are a lot of studies on exercise and there's really no doubt that moving is good for you and there are different levels of exercise i'm exercising right now not just my mouth but i have a standing desk right the reason i'm jumping around is because i'm always standing so that's exercise so that's one thing you can do uh if you want to walk that's important too 4 000 steps is considered the minimum 10 000 is an optimum uh if you go over that if you do about 12 000 and there's no additional benefit again uh not clear if you can overdo it but 12 000 steps i wouldn't go beyond that doesn't seem to be that great unless you know you're enjoying your view paper um wasn't it i thought there was wasn't there a paper from australia that was talking about how seven to ten was sort of ideal they actually just published a study a few months ago didn't they not yeah they did yeah we'll have to cite that yeah and actually what what happens is they found that um exercise can reach like that can reduce the incidence of age-related diseases by 23 and that includes everything from cancer to heart disease and even uh dementia and that's the great thing about exercise it stimulates this hormesis and it doesn't just affect your heart but it'll affect all sorts of things including inflammation um and depression these other things are affected too so please uh how i would say is just get off your butt move walk and run and in terms of the running you don't have to run first of all you you can row you can do any exercise that you like can be a game but you'd want to lose your breath for about 10 minutes three times a week that's considered the minimum and it induces what's called a state of hypoxia which is low oxygen and when you have low oxygen a few things happen your mitochondria start to produce free radicals and the mitochondrial response is also coromesis we call it mitochomesis and then you get activation of ampk due to low energy and the free radicals and that leads to this hormesis protective response you'll have better insulin sensitivity you'll have lower blood glucose levels which is very healthy and you'll start to build up muscle now you also not just building up muscle what you also need to do is to have better better blood flow and hypoxia will induce a protein called hypoxia inducible factor number one um bill calen a colleague of mine at harvard discovered this thing and he won a nobel prize a few years ago for it and it's a big deal because hypoxia inducible factor one controls very important pathways related to health and aging uh not least of which is inflammation and so by coming becoming a little bit hypoxic you will turn on this this defense pathway as well and people ask me how do you know when you've done enough hypoxia well if you cannot carry out a conversation easily you know you're in in a good state um you want your heart rate to be well over 100 but you don't want to get above 150 certainly for somebody in their 40s and 50s um and so you can't overdo it as well um but yeah just 10 minutes is all it takes a few times a week it's not that hard [Music] [Music] you
