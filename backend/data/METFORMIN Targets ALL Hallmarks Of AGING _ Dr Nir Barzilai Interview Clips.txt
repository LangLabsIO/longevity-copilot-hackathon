[Music] but forming targets all the hallmarks of aging right we agree on eight nine hallmarks of aging metformin targets all those hallmarks of aging now you must listen to that and said i'm crazy how can this drug targets all those hallmarks of aging and the truth is that it's similar to almost any other drug you know resveratrol had multiple effect and and rapamycin head all those gera therapeutics people started arguing it's doing this and that and not this and really what happens is really quite simple if you take an old cell or an old organ or whole body and make it younger then a lot of things are being fixed okay that doesn't mean that it's doing it primarily or independently it's just fixing it as part of being a general therapeutics and it's true for the hallmarks themselves you can fix one hallmark and affects all the other it's exactly the same thing because those hallmarks are not the causes of aging there's something that goes wrong with aging and if you fix it you extend health span or lifespan okay so this is the same with the drugs now it does mainly two things i think on one hand it targets the mitochondria complex one of the mitochondria and shifts energetic in a way that has a lot of metabolic uh metabolic outcomes on insulin action but also mtor then autophagy you know a lot of other things on one end on the on the other hand it because it's kind of a little uh it's it's an inhibitor for the mitochondria it prevents some of the oxidative damage inflammation and other things it also has actions that are not through the mitochondria not through amp kinase not not other ways but we don't know which of those effects are important for aging okay so we rather use metformin with everything that it seems to be doing rather than select and and say you know let's just hit complex one of the mitochondria it might not be enough [Music] you
