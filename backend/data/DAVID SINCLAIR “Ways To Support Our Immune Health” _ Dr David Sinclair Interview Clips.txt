[Music] uh from your deep scientific research uh but what do we really know about kova 19 what are we learning and i'm assuming that we're learning and globally collaborating every day we are and and so people may look at this and say well this this guy studies aging what's he talking about covert 19 for i'm just a few bits of information that might answer that um i study human aging which is important here i've started a vaccine company which bill gates invested in it's a public company so i've got that experience i've got a dna testing company that tests for covert 19 genetic material um and i i'm a gatherer of information i read a lot and try to synthesize things so there's all that so i feel somewhat able to speak on this topic though i'm not an md i'm a phd so what am i seeing well let let's talk about the biology we're now learning that in the body what happens is that the young people are very able to to keep the numbers of the virus down but old people are not and there's a number of differences between young and old bodies there are changes in the t cells um in diversity so young people have lots of different types of t cells old people don't they have this underlying level of inflammation that we've talked about that old old people don't benefit from they have less nad and defenses and that actually also leads to problems uh they have a dysregulated renin renin angiotensin system which you may know is modulated by the ace2 system and blood pressure drugs that's dysregulated there's changes to what our body adds to the surface of proteins in terms of sugar so proteins in the body have sugar attached including the ace2 receptor on our cells and the spike protein on the virus there's also changes in biological age which we can now measure we know exactly how old people are based on biology not just birthday candles and they also their cells also senesce so that part of the body becomes more zombie-like and that's certainly not helpful either but overall what happens is that these viruses become so numerous and then the dead viruses release their contents is that the body overreacts in the elderly you get inflammation of the eye of the veins in the body the very small capillaries or capillaries and this ends up in many cases blocking the blood flow in the body not just in the lungs but in the heart in the kidneys in the brain um and trying to stop that's very very difficult um because it's just once the body starts getting clogged up it can't get oxygen and you can't easily release those clots from the body without causing some damage so one of the things i'm involved with is trying to raise the energy levels in patients so that we can overcome a lot of those problems and shut down that hyper inflammation so you certainly explain the challenges in kova 19 that people over 60 or compromised immune systems heart issues diabetes and you mentioned earlier when talking about longevity which we didn't do as deep of a dive as i would like but limited on time the real important marker of blood sugar uh and what we take in is sugars is carbohydrates and a potential challenge that gives us in terms of raising that blood sugar and the impact that has potentially on inflammation uh and obviously on the potential of pre-diabetes okay you laid a bit of a foundation from a scientific perspective what can we do to protect ourselves is it simply enhancing our immune system if we're obese which 40 percent of americans are they're likely going to have heart issues they're going to have diabetes is it as simple as being in better shape well yeah it is it is if you are obese there are two problems that have happened to you one is that you've had a high level of blood sugar in your body because you're overeating and high blood sugar as we've said is is really bad there was a paper that just came out in the embo journal if you want to look it up embo that showed actually that high blood sugar levels leads to increased dna damage which as i've explained uh is part of the aging process that leads to the loss of information and cells lose right their identity so all of this is coming together in the information theory of aging that by overeating we're causing dna damage and scratching up our dvds but also what's happening is when you become obese your fat cells will start to naturally secrete inflammatory molecules and the overall inflammation in your body will go up and up and up and we know that chronic inflammation also accelerates the aging process uh and in terms of from and i know you want to be careful again we're not giving medical advice i'm not an md you're not an md but in terms of the scientific research relative to immunity broadly speaking uh having and this is where blood workups could certainly help but you mentioned vitamin d there's been some talk about certain forms of and high enough doses and some trials of vitamin c what are you reading well so i've started taking vitamin c uh liposomal um vitamins that's it yes and if you don't mind uh what dosage i'd have to run to my bathroom but it's a it's a hefty capsule i'm guessing it that it's 500 milligrams yeah but some people take much more you can go to a gram some people even higher but i i don't go high because it's been shown time and time again that high levels of this and other antioxidants can actually cause more damage including dna damage which of course we don't want so yeah i'm taking a moderate level of vitamin c every morning so you mentioned things like managing weight uh caloric restriction broadly being in good health with your immunity through exercise possibly cold water plunges if your heart could take it and saunas and you know vitamin d possibly vitamin c uh quartin i believe is another one that we're hearing of from an immunity perspective i'm probably pronouncing that wrong resveratrol which you spoke about nad which you were you know that was one of the ones you were really that's that's kind of beyond the forefront of what's going on you mentioned corsetin quercetin uh yes how it pronounced yep we mentioned olive oil which has oleic acid we've mentioned resveratrol there's another one called physin which is anti cell senescence all of these molecules actually bind to the sort 1 enzyme the pac-man and i don't think that's a coincidence i think this is telling us that turning on these stratuans is the way to go in our diet [Music] so [Music] [Applause] [Music] so [Music] [Applause] [Music] you
