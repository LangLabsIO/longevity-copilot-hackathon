[Music] let's start with sleep when i think about your work i think about hormesis it strikes me that sleep is a is a slightly odd ball because you could make the case that not sleeping well and not sleeping enough is sending your body a signal that actually that's a problem you know i need to hunker down which most of the evidence that i've seen suggest that you know getting decent amounts of sleep deep quality sleep actually helps reduce your risk of all kinds of diseases and i'm sure it's going to have an impact on aging as well right so sleep is an exception if you don't get enough sleep then you've got cortisol levels going up and it's it's very clear that if you don't sleep well you will age faster i'll give you a best example if you take if you take a rat and you deprive it of sleep for two weeks after that two weeks it will have type 2 diabetes that's how important sleep is and so think of sleep as something that's totally connected to the clock of aging so cert one is the enzyme that we work on in my lab and resveratrol and nad activate it we talked about residual talked about nad and anime now sort one is not just central to our health cardiovascular disease inflammation longevity but during the day this same enzyme controls the body's sleep-wake cycle without cert one you don't sleep properly your body doesn't um have a proper circadian rhythm as it's called so what does that mean well if you disrupt your sleep you're going to disrupt your body's ability to repair itself and actually as we get older our lack of cert 1 which is often due to obesity and lack of exercise will make it harder to sleep normally as well and and there are plenty of people who are elderly who do not sleep well in part because their certain one and their nad fluctuations are out of sync and not not really high amplitude they just waddle along so what does this mean it means sleep is longevity and longevity gives you sleep and they're interconnected and to mess with one and not get the right amount of sleep is just going to put you on a path of aging more quickly i think i read somewhere that in your own life uh you you've had to make some changes in order to sleep better one of them being wearing blue light blocking glasses is that correct yeah i've never slept well without help i typically um go to bed late i've been going lately to sleep pretty late uh one two three o'clock in the morning um eight friends overseas this is my problem but but i've learned to be able to [Music] modify my life so that i get better sleep and deeper sleep um but yeah i now re relax i don't read emails past 10 o'clock and i also tend to wind down and not stress uh late at night and the blue black blue light blocking glasses have been helpful too i try not to stare at a screen and if i do i turn down the blue light on my computer and on my phone when you were talking about cert one there i also thought well actually reversing someone's age actually may also help improve their sleep right because as you get older you don't sleep so well for a variety of reasons including biological ones so it seems reasonable then that reversing the clock is actually for some people going to help them sleep better yeah right well exercise and um and a good diet really does help with sleep we see that what i'd like to do now is now that we can reverse the age of the brain is test if uh that improves the sleep wake cycle of these old mice um we do know that if we feed them nmn or resveratrol they do sleep better and they have better rhythms and so that would fit with that theory [Music] you
