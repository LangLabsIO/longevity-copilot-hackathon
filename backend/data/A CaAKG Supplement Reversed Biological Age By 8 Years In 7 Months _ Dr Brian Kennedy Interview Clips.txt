[Music] these natural products like nad precursors that are talked about a lot in the aging field and alpha ketoglutarate um they go they tend to go down with age their important metabolites and so they uh reduce the sort of the metabolic flexibility of the cell with age the problem with trying to understand what they're doing is they participate in like like akgs and over 500 enzymatic reactions in the cell and so if you want to figure out what the proximal effects are that are linked to aging you've got a challenge on your hands and we've been struggling with that uh we can show that it improves adult stem cell function that they hit these hallmarks and pillars of aging like a lot of other interventions do but what we really want to know is what's the direct activity of akg and so we're trying to sort through that now there are a few clues uh alpha-ketoglutarate doesn't easily get taken up by cells so um it there are certain tissues like liver and kidney which is red blood cells which take it out uh and that's ex and that gives us a target area to look at so we think that one of the things akg does is it improves glutathione production in red blood cells which is important because they're carrying a lot of oxygen around and there's a lot of reactive oxygen damage in those cells but we're also looking at different metabolic effects in the kidney and other things right now so i don't really have the full answer it's probably not just one thing that's relevant to aging but we're still sorting among the possibilities there are interesting microbiome effects of akg as well we do have human data we published a study clinical study a few months ago showing that 42 users of this rejuvent product which is a product made by pdl health they contain the alpha-ketoglutarate plus low-dose vitamin a for men and logos vitamin d for women reverses biologic age by about seven years using one of these methylation clocks now first of all i'm affiliated with that company so full disclosure second of all we didn't have a placebo control those are just people buying the product so i don't think it's the final validation that it works in humans but it's very encouraging and now we have a clinical study performed in the state of indiana that we're analyzing the data from and it looks like we might get signals for other aging clocks as well so we're in and that is placebo control so we're encouraged and i think that we need to take these interventions that may affect aging and test more of them in the context of these biomarkers to see which ones work the best but but more specifically to find which individuals which interventions work in i think that it's going to be a personalized approach to understand aging not just give one thing to everybody and we need to understand why some people respond to some interventions and some people don't you know we were doing animal studies looking at not just aging lifespan but frailty and we found that vitamin a in low dose is very beneficial for the male mice but not the females in ways we we're still trying to figure that one out uh vitamin d is probably beneficial for both so but the thing is that we also found that when you start combining multiple interventions you get unpredictable outcomes and so this is something i would caution people about is there now products out there that have 14 different longevity molecules in them or or you can buy them separately and take them yourself when i do mouse aging studies once i get even in two and certainly at three i can't predict the outcome of combining interventions that's something we're very focused on in the lab right now so you know if people want to be early adopters yeah i would suggest picking one or two things you're that are your favorites and doing that um and not just picking everything because i don't know what you're doing at that point um also with the vitamins you know these vitamins are in such widespread use you know i think the optimal approach to that really is to know the levels of your vitamins and micronutrients in your body and try to optimize those to a recommended amount which would be in the high normal range uh if you're taking too much vitamin it can be just as bad as too little particularly to something like vitamin a so a lot of people go by vitamins and just take them on faith but really it'd be better if you knew what your vitamin d levels really are before you go start taking things in and only take the things that you need to be supplemented [Music] you
