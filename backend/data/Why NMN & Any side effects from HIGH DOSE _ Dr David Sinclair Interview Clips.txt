[Music] if to make nad you the cell uses nmn which is nicotinamide mononucleotide which you can buy as a supplement and then to make a cell makes nmn from nr and the cell makes nr from vitamin b3 so you can take any one of those and raise nad levels but what we've discovered in people in clinical trials is that the closer you get to the nad itself the better the boost in nad that you get but you can't take nad itself because it's a very big molecule and it doesn't get in through the membrane of the cells so nmn does that and what we will report but i'll tell you live now is that if you take or if we give a gram to our subjects human subjects for 10 days they will double their energy levels in their blood cells and in fact if you give two grams you triple it now so i take a gram a day to double my levels to get me back to being a 20 year old in the expectation and somewhat hope that my body is now defending itself against aging um there are a lot of questions about whether or not you can take too much nad can your levels be too high in your body there's no evidence of that yet uh we've given mice a lot of nmn for years uh for years in their life at high doses haven't seen any negative effects in the human clinical trials we haven't gone more than two grams a day uh one in the morning one in the afternoon but no negative side effects there and looking at extensive blood biochemistry um health so i don't know of any yet um like anything you can always overdose in it you can overdose on water so you need to be very careful and and if you're gonna try a supplement don't take the full amount in my view it's better to ramp it up and check your blood and work with your doctor to make sure you're not doing any damage to your body particularly the liver is susceptible to supplements so i monitor myself through a company that i work with called inside tracker but you can work with your doctor and just make sure that your body's healthy as you do something new like that but you know if there was a problem with nmn i would stop taking it and i certainly would alert my family and friends as well but i haven't seen anything yet [Music] you
