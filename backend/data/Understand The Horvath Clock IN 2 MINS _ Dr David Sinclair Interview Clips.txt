[Music] horrible clock is one of the biggest discoveries in the aging field of all time steve came at this question of aging separate from me but we've come to the same conclusion now what steve discovered and and some other scientists but he gets then gets to name it the whole earth clock what it is it's it's chemical changes that occur on the dna called methylation and these methylation marks normally what they do is they tell a cell what they should what a cell should do so if if you've got a certain number of methylation marks you'll be a nerve cell and if you have different ones you'll be a skin cell we call this the epigenetic marks and without them cells lose their identity they become dysfunctional and eventually they even senesce meaning they stop dividing and sit around in the body and cause inflammation now what steve discovered was that if you use machine learning and look at the various marks that change with age in a human or in a mouse or even in a bat he sees that there are certain marks that change and certain ones that don't and he can take a blood sample from from anyone i mean he could take your blood if he hasn't already and he could tell you when you're gonna die within pretty you know within perhaps certain parameters a few years and what's interesting about that is you can actually change the trajectory of that aging you can be healthy you can take supplements that we think can slow it down maybe even some hormone treatments that may reverse it and we're working in my lab on ways to truly reset that clock and go back in time but the horveth clock is the first time that we can have a tool that unambiguously tells us if something is either slowing or accelerating the aging process [Music] you
