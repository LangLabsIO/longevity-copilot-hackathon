[Music] so [Music] and i've been experimenting with nmn and spiritual and i've of course i've read your book twice and i followed your work and there's so much i'm actually experimenting with something that might strike your interest uh i i combined i tested eneman and resvertol first and then in large quantities to see what happens then i went back to the proper dose then i tested doing it in a liposome like i got element powder and resveratrol powder and i put some sunflower lecithin and i broke it with the ultrasonic waves yes and i was able to get way better results with that even with a smaller dose because of the observability what do you mean by results uh that's that's the interesting part so when i first tried anime and resveratol um i started with a low dose and then i started to increase it in the powder form i started with a low dose and then i started to increase it gradually and uh then i really increased it to a very high dose to see what happens so like not very very high but like two grams each twice a day that was a high this is a high dose right yeah right that's that's four times what i take yeah yeah it's a very high dose when i did that i actually got extreme um like pressure in the head and uh at one one night like two days into that experiment uh my nose started bleeding out of nowhere so i knew it yeah i knew it i knew it was time to stop it probably yeah so i stopped i stopped that immediately and i went back to the normal dose which was like half a gram each every day i take it with mct oil i i because i'm assuming it's fat soluble so i have to do that and uh then i stopped taking the powder form and i started taking the liposome form which i did the way i told you and uh since this first day i think i'm noticing like increased activity i'm noticing i didn't notice that with the powder form i noticed increased activity with the liposome form and then my friend started us asking to get some and i give some to my friends and they start experimenting with it and they they're experiencing similar results along with like um i don't know how like facial like the skin of the face is also more vibrant and it looks better so yeah i'm seeing results with the liposome form and uh you know that i i have my poor man's version which is my yogurt yeah i actually actually was just eating it when you called um let me show you something um yeah so this is how i have my two spoonfuls of yogurt every day i just finished it you know you can still see yeah and then uh and then i'm still having my coffee with than a man so i i show you that um only because you know a lot of people just say what they think is right or even they lie whereas you know you and i are really living it um what we say we're doing we're very uh accurate and truthful about what we're doing yeah yeah yeah i could say oh i take in a man and yogurt every day and then maybe eat it once a week and i'm just lying but now that you've seen this is my breakfast yeah with you today um anyway so i take four of these these that's that's the anime and the resveratrols was dissolved in this so this is water soluble this is um not oh the liposomes are for for what both molecules are just one uh for both molecules i'm putting like maybe four grams uh each and the men and resveratrol with about let's say 20 grams of sunflower lecithin i dissolve it in maybe 100 ml of water and then i break it in an ultrasonic machine which i actually built myself so i like to experiment it's my thing so so the ratio of sunflower lecithin in water is what uh like four grams per grams with 20 grams of sunflower less less i think in 100 ml of water approximately it's not accurate i didn't base it on anything i just found i thought that would be a proper ratio and i honestly like i use like five drops of that three times a day and i'm experiencing results but when i took the powder i didn't really experience anything significant i wasn't sure of the results did you solve resveratrol in anything or used a powder reservoir um with the liposome or with the when i first experimented with that when you first had the powder with resveratrol did you mix it with anything uh mct oil i took it with mct oil capsule yeah because i'm basically vegan so i didn't use the yogurt um i just used i reasoned that mct always should do the trick yeah i would have thought so [Music] it's worth pointing out that the things that i'm talking about today haven't been proven to work in humans right we're talking about anecdotal evidence but there is a lot of evidence in animal studies so far mostly mouse studies and you know the skeptics would say mice don't prove anything and and it's true they don't prove anything but they are some guide if something fails in a mouse it's probably going to fail in a human if it works in a mouse it has a chance to work in a human that's usually the rule um and so yeah we've been doing human studies more recently on nad boosters um a relative of nmn it's called mib 626 and it is uh it's it's there's no safety issue so far and uh but it's it's not a huge dose like like you were taking um people have to be very careful i think with these substances right because they haven't been tested rigorously [Music] yeah that's the warning i don't want to come across as uh you know a scientist saying we should all be testing things in our bodies because you have to be not just careful but you have to like you and me monitor our bodies to make sure that we're not doing any harm or seemingly getting harmed um and uh yeah so unless you're working with a doctor and having blood tests so tomorrow i'm going to have a blood test to see how things are going yeah and you know if i if i did see changes in liver enzymes which might show some toxicity i would immediately stop uh so far i haven't seen any issues makes perfect sense of course yeah um i i've done some very interesting things over the past it seems like unintentionally i've activated two of the three uh aging pathways uh uh i'll deactivate it let's say so basically i eat uh zero sugars and zero carbs and uh like completely no carbs nothing that raises the blood sugar in any way as in as in if i feel if i eat like one piece of cashew i would feel it for the next three days so yeah yeah i'm completely uh i'm fueled completely by like fat seeds and nuts i'm vegan so i'm like a vegan keto guy don't ask me how it's going but i eat zero carbs nothing that raises blood sugar in any way and i've been doing this for the past seven years and then you you have a patch you monitor yourself so you know uh interesting thing is that i have 5.5 body fat and i play sports every day martial arts i'm very active and uh my blood sugar in the morning is around 85 to 90. so and i've been doing this for the past seven years so this proves everything you're doing experimentally i suppose so i'm activating the uh aging path pathways the insulin pathway and the mtor pathway i'm deactivating them like i don't know it's just uh like this is what how what experimentation took me this is the path i didn't read it in any book this is just how i felt comfortable going through the years and this is what i ended up with right well it's an interesting diet um yeah because carnivorism i'm i'm not convinced it's healthy in the long run it'll help you build muscle of course but there's no experiments that i've seen that say eating a lot of meat is long-term beneficial the uh and also like you said if you eat carbs i i'm also i don't like carbs at all i think based on the evidence that keeping blood sugar um steady and low is is good as long as you don't feel affected in your daily life or faint and i've actually gone to the to get one of these glucose monitors that you stick in your arm and it shocked me what the foods i was eating did to my blood sugar just um a few bites of sushi with rice shot it through the roots absolutely um and then i also found that my body produces sugar in the morning naturally and i don't need breakfast i i'm totally fine and in fact if i eat a big breakfast i feel sick and it's probably because my body isn't is an early glucose producer some people are different some people feel faint in the morning they need food to get going and sometimes they're doing a big workout which i i cannot do in the morning so the point here is everybody is different and you need to pay attention to your body and um i seriously came to the conclusion that sugar acts like a drug but once you stop that gradually and wisely of course your body gets accustomed to taking its energy from fat which we call kiru and uh then um if like if i eat i can't eat onions anymore i can't eat carrots anymore because once i eat it i'm bothered by it it's like my body switches back to taking simple glucose and it doesn't want that it's uh it's happy taking it from flax seeds and seeds and nuts and veggies and yeah seaweeds and like similar stuff and that's that's another question uh you are an advocate of metformin uh because you're seeing a lot of um benefits from using it health-wise and considering aging as well right my question is yeah why don't we just stop eating sugar and starch and get these results naturally instead of blocking glucose absorption with metformin uh well i'm i'm not an advocate i don't recommend anything um but i do speak about the science and i've read many papers on this topic um there are there are two main points one is that it's always better to do it naturally than to take a molecule or a drug a supplement so you're right about that but where i think it's important to to discuss is the point that metformin seems to do more than just lower blood sugar we don't know how metformin works it seems to work both on the muscle on the fat and even on the microbiome yeah so it's quite possible that just keeping low glucose isn't sufficient to mimic metformin i don't know if the kind of diet you're taking if it was tested on 100 000 people would also like metformin reduce cancer heart disease frailty and alzheimer's yeah so you know there's i'm always driven by the data and a hundred thousand people in a publication will always override logic and uh anecdote yeah i get it i get it so we showed way back in the early 2000s that the these plant molecules do activate uh the same pathways many of the same pathways as fasting and exercise and that was a revelation that that was surprising to people now we take it for granted that you can trigger a fasting without fasting using molecules from plants so yeah i do believe that if i take or when i take resveratrol in the morning uh it will activate cert one and certain one we've actually shown at least in mice that sort one is actively promoting blood vessel growth and mitochondrial function just like fasting and exercise would do i try to do both because it looks like they're additive if we give a resveratrol to mice that only every second day those are the ones live the longest so combining fasting and or exercise with these molecules i think is the best solution um i i think of of the longevity pathways as a piano and you can't just smash one key or a smash with your fist and hope it plays beautiful music you will want to play the symphony and we don't know what the symphony is yet um it's still early days we were all born one generation too early for us to to know this for a fact and that's why you know i'm willing to talk about it because uh i think that at a minimum we can have millions of people live healthier lives based on the science right now yeah absolutely [Music] you
