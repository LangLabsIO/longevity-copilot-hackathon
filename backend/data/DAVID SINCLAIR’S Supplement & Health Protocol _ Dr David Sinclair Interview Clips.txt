[Music] well i i still use inside tracker and uh i just posted on instagram that i think i broke the record at the company um i didn't realize i was but but they saw my post and they said holy crap you know you're a decade younger more than a decade actually um so that that was pretty cool so what have i done to achieve this well it is in the book and i think most of you have read it but i have changed some some things since 2019 and i've added some things and i've taken some things away what i've added are a leg acid i'm taking um some spermidine now a grama day and uh uh some synalytics so physin and quercetin we discovered back in 2003 were lifespan extending molecules and those appear to not just activate certain one like resveratrol does but also kilos ness and cells at high doses so i have done that and i'm monitoring myself also epigenetically uh to see if i'm actually reversing my epigenetic age which you know from my book is one number that's very important um and i am going backwards according to a number of those um clocks so that that's good news that you can send your age back let's not just slow it down but actually the biggest change since 2019 is my food intake i have cut myself back to one and a half meals a day a very small lunch a snack maybe late in the day and then a healthy regular dinner i'm a struggling vegan at the moment um i don't eat meat but occasionally i'll take a slice of cheese or an oyster or something but generally i'm plant-based and i've been doing that only for three months um one of my inspirations and i think some of you have heard of serena who and i met her a few months ago and she's been uh inspiring me with with facts and knowledge so i've done that i've cut out alcohol to see what happens um there are social occasions where i miss it and i think you don't have to cut it out but i'm doing an experiment um and so that's my life now i've lost a fair amount of weight i used to be 149 pounds 150 at max and i'm now 132. um and i feel great i look great i have a lot better energy my glucose levels instead of doing this are now through the day and i have a i took some photos of the of the the readings uh over the last few days which i can i think i did this is this is a typical me um um so that that's really the thing and then the inside tracker data also says that i'm doing really really well i've gone down in age by a few years since i've started on this diet um i miss meat i wish meat extended lifespan uh i would eat meat all the time but the data just says that's not going to help you will feel good great in the short run there are a lot of carnivores who tell me i don't know what i'm talking about because they feel great and if you feel great that must mean it's good for you well that's not true um what you think have to think about is that there are two states of the body there's well there's three there's there's homeostasis but then you're either in in adversity or abundance abundance will make you feel energetic and grow your body so make more muscle and then there's the adversity mimetics or the adversity signals which the supplements in my lifestyle are aimed at mimicking and you still have the energy because your body adjusts but your body fights against aging because it's worried that it might die in a couple of weeks time and that's what it but what fasting and exercise and the supplements um and cold and heat are designed to do is to get the body to be afraid of dying in the near future [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] you
