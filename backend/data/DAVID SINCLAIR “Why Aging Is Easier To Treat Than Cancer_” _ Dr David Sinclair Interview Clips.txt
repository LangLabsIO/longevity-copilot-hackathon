[Music] so [Music] it's changed a lot when i first started in this field going back oh now 25 years ago it was pretty rare that people took it seriously there were very few scientists working on this topic of aging and there wasn't a strong discussion or any serious discussion in the public at least about working on aging it was disease and disability and death and then there was aging but that's changed a lot that we now as you know a populist world populous uk america australia many countries are really interested in first of all understanding why we age second of all figuring out how to extend the period of youth in life so extending our health span and then i think just as importantly what the impact would be on our lives and also on the world's economy and on the planet if these things actually it's more of a when these things that we're working on actually become an eventuality so david i'm going to um ask you one of the things that you say which is aging is easier to treat than cancer so how is that possible yeah well so aging is uh governed by these inbuilt pathways that we have we share these with yeast and little round worms and flies and mice of course and we don't even need to understand what causes aging to be able to treat it we can tap into those we also just published a paper in nature a few months ago where we just put three genes into a mouse and reversed the age of its tissues we focused on the eye and restored uh you know reverse blindness restored their eyesight it's extraordinary that just just i mean i can't kind of believe this i mean in the paper we have the wolverine example which is regeneration and that's what david's talking about it's staggering it's not even slowing down aging it's literally reversing sorry it really we have the ability now to turn back the clock first of all we can measure the body's clock i could take linda i could take your blood sample and or a cheek swab and tell you pretty accurately within about five percent of your biological age not your chronological age and then predict when you go to die but because we have these tools now to measure aging accurately and the age of your body or a mouse's body in this case we could actually measure and prove that we reversed the age of of that mouse's eye by about 70 percent and then these tissues come back to life like they were young again but the point is that that wasn't very difficult once you know how to do it uh you know similar to columbus you know once someone shows you how to do it it's a matter of just sailing in that direction and this this you know any student could do this in fact a high school student now could use these three genes to rejuvenate if they wanted to probably their pet dog or pet cat's not that hard once you know what you're doing so that's why i say aging is going to be easier to treat than cancer which is many different diseases uh cancer there's hundreds of different types with probably thousands of different mutations that cause it whereas aging is relatively simple what we've learned from these experiments that we just published is that there's a backup copy of youthfulness in the body that you can tap into and reset the system there's that information it's akin to polishing a scratched dvd and getting the movie or the music to play again it's that simple stephen what is more likely delaying aging or reversing aging well i think in the short term we're going to be able to delay aging metformin is already a potential solution to that and there are many drugs in development that do that there are drugs that eliminate the zombie cells we call these senescence cells in the body those are in development uh there are ones that have little uh little proteins that you can inject into the blood that have rejuvenation qualities uh and there's really a long list mitochondrial boosters uh nad boosters is what i work on these are these are chemicals that raise a chemical that declines during aging that activates the body's defenses so slowing aging i think is is in the cards someone's going to get a drug on the market probably in the next five years hopefully sooner we hope to treat a person in the next couple of years to hopefully restore their eyesight glaucoma patients would be one group that we could treat but ultimately where i think age reversal is heading is that we can reverse the age of of any tissue and ultimately if we look forward maybe 15 20 years rejuvenating the entire body and then just repeating it every decade or so there's another revolution that's happening that is becoming democratized cheaper this revolution is going on as we speak and that's the ability to monitor patients very extensively not just in hospital anymore but at home there are devices actually patches that don't cost much you stick them on for a couple of weeks and you get motion you get falls heart rate body temperature a whole range dozens of measurements actually in real time and these developments in this monitoring and ability to react when somebody's going to have a heart attack before it's already happened for example or even changes in mood for depression this will be happening over the next 5-10 years and that in combination with these cheap molecules that are being developed i think will dramatically change people's lives for the better and extend people's healthy lifespan
