[Music] uh so we're going back to the mid early 1990s now and we didn't have the tools to manipulate human cells we could barely change one gene but in yeast we could change a gene overnight and so you know kids like me in my early 20s we learned genetics using baker's yeast um and on the side we would make beer and meat in in the warm room so that was an added bonus but yeast cells are eukaryotes they have 16 chromosomes um or 32 if they mate and fuse and they actually function very similar to our own cells and and that sounds crazy right because this is a fungus versus a mammalian animal like us but the basic building blocks of how life works very similar they have linear chromosomes not not like bacteria which are circular they get hungry they need to find a mate they starve to death they have a life span they age they get old they actually get big and fat and round and slow and sterile and so i trained during my phd years in sydney australia learning about a disease called maple syrup urine disease uh and you can guess what the symptom is of that disease uh and i cloned three genes uh in yeast cells that were identical very closely matched to the human ones and so i was of the mindset already that yeast could tell us a lot about human diseases um and i had a fascination with aging and at the time no one was doing in a rigorous way the genetics of aging and longevity this sterility of old yeast cells turns out that these sirtuins these enzymes normally they control a variety of cell functions including mating and during aging they get distracted primarily by dna damage and they leave the place on the chromosome and go and help repair the dna but in doing so and while they're distracted the yeast cells are sterile and that was the big finding in the 1990s when i left mit and started my own lab at harvard i wondered what could be similar about that process going on in our cells and spen have spent literally the last 20 years trying to figure that out and now we know that these sort of enzymes there are seven in our bodies there are five in yeast seven in ours they're called certain one to seven the sir part of it's interesting sur stands for silent information regulator number two and the information is important we'll get back to that of course but what we now know is that these sort of can be activated uh naturally by being a little bit hungry or exercising uh caloric restriction is one way but we also know you can activate them with chemicals there are natural and synthetic ones that we've worked on and also because these are at least three of them control the way genes are turned on and off because you know gene expression we think that the the changes in gene expression as we get older in part due to the distraction of sirtuins among other things that occur and it gets worse as we get older with more dna damage distracting them that's i believe the major driver of aging certainly one of the major drivers [Music] [Music] you
