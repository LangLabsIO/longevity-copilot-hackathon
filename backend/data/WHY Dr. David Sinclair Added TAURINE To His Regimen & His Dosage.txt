[Music] foreign 2023 a study entitled taurine deficiency as a driver of Aging has been published in science the study investigated the impact of an amino acid taurine on Health and Longevity across various animal models with the findings indicating that restoring age-related touring loss through supplementation improves longevity and health Span in animal models later Dr Sinclair tweeted the study and he expressed his opinion in a New York Times article Dr Sinclair said he had dabbled with Turin in the past but based on the new paper he said he would likely at high doses of touring to his regimen with regular blood testing for possible side effects my caution and heartfelt concern really is that people will just take it and not monitor their bodies he said let's hear Dr Sinclair says about taurine and his dosage in one of his recent interview so touring touring is a semi-essential amino acid that we need for sure when we're babies but we start to make it when we're older some animals don't make touring like a cat now what is being published recently was in the news and I tweeted about it was that so Tony is being found uh high doses are typically around two to five grams a day it's high dose lowest blood pressure improves cardiovascular health improves the lipids um and uh and seems to improve blood pressure as well this is all great right sounds like anti-aging to me because you can find it in sports drinks and energy drinks but it's it's pretty low concentration usually now this amino acid was shown in the science paper from last week so when you give it to mice they have a lot of health benefits that are similar to what I just described in humans and they even gave it to monkeys and found that their health improved but the big deal was that those mice lived um because by my recollection I think it was 12 to 16 longer I'll check on that but it was it was a significant extension of lifespan which is a big deal because if it had a negative side effect they probably wouldn't have lived longer and so um I think taurine is super interesting the thing that confuses me and the literature right now and scientists is taurine is found in me right and taurine is also known to activate M4 things to provide longevity despite acting invading mtorp and so this is going to you know spark a debate discussion with the carnivores of course you can buy touring on the internet make sure it's a supplier that sells clean pure GMP grade taurine I'm currently taking uh two grams a day and to see how that works with me that's a pretty high dose I'll measure myself I'll report back um as always you want to measure yourself in case there's any negative side effects in order to make sure it's benefiting you as well otherwise it's a waste of time [Music] [Applause] [Music]
