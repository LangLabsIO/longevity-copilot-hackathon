[Music] senescent cells are old cells that stop dividing and put out inflammatory molecules called cytokines and they've been shown in animals and some studies in humans but if you get rid of them kill them off the body recovers and heals and becomes more youthful and that includes treating metabolic disease and high blood sugar as well and jim kirkland who's at the mayo clinic is the world's expert in this and he's running human clinical trials so he's a friend of mine so we were up to speed on that and what he's shown is that there are plant molecules and some drugs that work to kill those senescent cells and not so much normal cells of course you don't want to touch the normal cells there are drugs there's no veda clocks there's the satniv but the ones that are available to the regular consumer are quercetin which is again a plant polyphenol similar in shape to resveratrol another one i call it physique hesitant and uh it's also a plant molecule these two are shown to either prevent the senescent cells from secreting those inflammatory molecules that's called a cinnomorphic or in the case of physique it's it's actually can kill those senescent cells and uh there's a group that uh university of minnesota uh laura nidokova uh and paul robbins have shown that if you give physin to mice they actually live longer by about 10 by my recollection but what's interesting about it it also works if you give it to the mice midway through their lifespan to extend their lifespan and the other thing it's not very well known but because it goes back a number of years but in 2003 my lab published a nature paper that showed that resveratrol activates cert one but in that group was also quercetin and physique and so those three are ones that i take regularly not just to to work on senescence cells but they also activate uh certain ones you get this double potential double benefit but overall i i think that's analytics are really interesting um and can be really useful to prevent that type of uh aging which is called caused by inflammation [Music] [Music] you
