[Music] uh so this is an an egg cell and when it's fertilized and you wait a little bit Shake It Up cook it up and you end up with one or more of these uh if you're lucky and this is really quite a remarkable process I think I don't need to tell you that but trying to understand how this happens you have to understand epigenetics how is it that cells with very similar genomes are able to produce cells with all of these varieties of functions and maintain those functions and cell identities for up to 120 or so years in some very lucky individuals how does that happen and fortunately we have increasingly better tools to understand how this actually happens in this in these babies actually there's 26 billion cells each one of them has to be stably maintained and if you get a rogue cell you get cancer if it becomes dysfunctional you get disease or at least a bunch of cells and tissues and one of the first people that got a lot of credit for trying to understand in concept how this happens from a fertilized cell or a stem cell to a tissue is Conrad Waddington who in the 1950s proposed what you may have heard of as the Waddington hypothesis which is the idea that cells that have no identity will metaphorically roll down a hill and end up in valleys where they stay so that they don't a skin cell doesn't suddenly turn into a liver cell and a kidney cell doesn't turn into an eye cell you know of course there's there's many cells within those tissues as well that needs to be maintained but in the Aging field we very rarely if ever thought about development and vice versa those studying development hadn't really little interest in aging but uh that's changing uh many people in the Aging field have now thought about this at least that perhaps aging may not be a evolutionary conserved process to cause aging we don't believe aging is a an Adaptive event but it may be related to the epigenome and what I mean by that is and there's increasing evidence uh across the field some from from my lab over the last decade is that cells that are terminally differentiated can actually move around on this Waddington landscape uh and start to become more like other cell types over time and we see this happen during aging we don't know if it causes aging but it certainly doesn't help their gene expression patterns and in my lab we call this x differentiation uh you can call it what what you want could be epigenetic drift epigenetic noise but it definitely happens when you look and we have tools now to look at this at the Single Cell level so that's that's pretty well established the question is could you ever get the cells to go either back up the hill and go back to where they came from um or ever go back all the way up the hill well we know from shiny yamanaka's work that you can go all the way back up the hill but can you go sideways that's been the question so a little bit more uh representation of what I'm talking about this is uh the chromosomes in a Cell this could be a yeast cell could be a mammalian cell they're shown in Black and these are areas of heterochromatin which silence genes some of them are found at the periphery such as the sirtuins that I've been working on for most of my career they control silencing and heterochromatin and there are open genes that transcribe RNA and those genes are on and often in Loops that are exposed to the to the cell Machinery but over time what we see is changes in those and genes that should be left on become Switched Off and vice versa and we believe this is leading to a partial loss of identity but the question is why would this happen how does it happen so we can do two tests one is what we've actually done is test some cellular perturbations we've tried DNA damage and we've tried cell injury and asked do these does that mimic the natural changes during aging and this is um was a review that came out it was in cell by Young if you say correctly and what he was describing was a study where we created breaks in mammalian culture uh mammalian cells and in mice and we found that the relocalization required these uh DNA damage checkpoint proteins so this wasn't just a random drift that this really was an active process that required phosphorylation chemical modification of the actual histones at the break and it's one of the first steps the movement of cert1 which is the homolog of the Soto yeast Gene that I talked about this enzyme uh Gene product the enzyme moves to the brakes recruits repair proteins and then most of it goes back to where it came from and we could see this also recapitulated during aging this process of moving away from the suit one regulated promoters this enzyme was very useful to us it's been used to study DNA break repair for many years in vitro but we started to use it in Vivo I use it we use it in our lab because it doesn't cut very often there's only about 18 consensus sites across the genome it does cut the rdna which we had to be very careful we weren't just trashing the genome but um it's been very useful because it stimulates a very very mild damage response in fact it's so mild you can barely detect any activation of these factors um by a western blot you won't see p53 activated for example it's we call it chromosome tickling to distinguish it from other types of study [Music]
