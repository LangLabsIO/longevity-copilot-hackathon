[Music] we didn't study red wine we we came about it through a different route and we were studying yeast actually and we're also studying the human enzyme in test tubes and we were trying to figure out uh out of thousands of molecules which ones might activate the enzyme and you know obviously we were thinking in those days as we still are that you can't genetically modify a human easily um ethically it's much easier if you can take a a safe supplement or a molecule or a drug and so with conrad howitz my collaborator uh we looked at many molecules and found a set of about 20 different molecules most of them from plants in the class of what's called polyphenols that were apparently activating this enzyme in the test tube and we spent about six months trying to to prove that wrong because it was quite an unexpected thing to be able to activate cert one by more than 10 times activity and it you know it's when when you discover something that crazy you've got to try your best to disprove it because a lot of people are going to come after you uh scientists are that way but nevertheless we couldn't disprove it so we published that resveratrol activates certain one quite effectively when you put it on to yeast cells they live longer and that requires the sirtuin gene that it was targeting and then uh so we put that out there and that got a lot of attention but then the really big paper was three years later where we showed that mice could be tricked into believing that they were calorie restricted that they were on a lean diet even though they were eating a western fatty diet and the mice were still fat but their organs were beautiful and clean and their the physiology and their molecular biology was telling us that they were actually as healthy as the lean ones and then um we looked at their lifespan and they lived just as long as the the healthy ones and uh a lot of people have have you know moved on and forgotten that that was the first safe molecule to effectively mimic fasting um then there was this uh disagreement about how researchers actually activating cirque juan and it was a question you know again uh scientists like to do this but you know i like to joke that scientists fight because the stakes are so low my technology was licensed uh my technology was licensed to glaxosmithkline which at the time was the number two pharma company in the world and we had a patent they had a patent that they licensed that blocked anyone else activating sertuans and then so pfizer got into it and said well that mechanism is wrong and the patent is invalid and that was a big food fight for a number of years uh and i was sandwiched in between the number one and number two pharmaceutical company in the world um and you know the media went went crazy on this too we we had raised the the sales of red wine by 30 so we got a lot of attention for that um but then it's also interesting that what if it's wrong wouldn't that be an amazing scandal uh and so after many years of research that's actually still continuing in my lab uh we we came back and proved that we were right through some really hard and and i think really important work that we published in the journal science in 2013 and then we have some crystal structures and we now understand very in great detail how resveratrol works to activate the enzyme we also made a mouse that doesn't get activated by resveratrol just by changing one amino acid in the protein and that mouse is not responding to resveratrol it doesn't live longer when you give it the molecule you know now i'm talking a lot more about resveratrol because that's all behind us fortunately i'd love to have those drugs go back into those human studies we actually had activators that were a thousand times more active than resveratrol and they went into patients and we've published that or jim krueger in new york published that those molecules one of them at least works in psoriasis in patients and uh you know these molecules are anti-inflammatory cert one is an anti-inflammatory molecule um and so yeah those molecules right now sit on the shelf at glucosamine klein and i'd love to restart those trials because i think they have huge um there's a huge opportunity not just to treat inflammatory disorders but really any age-related disease [Music] you
