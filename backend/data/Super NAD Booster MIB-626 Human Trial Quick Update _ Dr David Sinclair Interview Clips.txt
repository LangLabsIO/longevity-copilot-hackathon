foreign [Music] interestingly I've been working with a team in Boston on making an NAD precursor a drug and so for the last two years with the help of a great team at Brigham and Women's Hospital they've been testing the safety and efficacy of an NAD precursor called mib626 which is a proprietary version of an NAD booster is that so far the molecule is extremely safe in the people that have been tested it's able to greatly raise energy levels we've worked on activators of sirtuins for a long time Resveratrol was the one back 20 years ago we've developed some synthetic ones and some NAD precursors our mib626 is as I mentioned an oral formulation of a polymorph of mh66 that stabilized crystalline and it's gone through a lot of safety studies of over the last few years headed by this lab are shally basin's group at Brigham and Women's Hospital and David Livingston runs the group at Metro biotech which is a massachusetts-based company that's been making NAD precursors both synthetic and natural for the last decade uh and that and full disclosure this was spun out of my lab and others including shinamai and rajapter how do you measure what the effect might be well one of the ways that Shelley's lab did it was to look at endurance and strength within an MRI uh and so this is uh an example of the machine that they built to insert the patients into the machine and measure their endurance strength and things like uh ATP NAD oxygenation and some of the data that hasn't probably been published yet but we're starting to talk about it and this is their group status not mine uh is that uh a number of things happen when you take uh 1 000 milligrams from roughly a month of this uh substance orally and you can see here an example of some of the data uh the repetitions to failure of that leg exercise uh significantly greater after taking mib636 this is similar or at least reminiscent to the mouse data that we published in 2018 on endurance in mice uh due to increased vascularization of the action on endothelial cells another nice bit of data I would admit it was a surprise a nice surprise is that Shelley's group showed that lipids and cholesterol went in the right direction for improved Health as you can see here HDL was not affected which was also reassuring [Music]
