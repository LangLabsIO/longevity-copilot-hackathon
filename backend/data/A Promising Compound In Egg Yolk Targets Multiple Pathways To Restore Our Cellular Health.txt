[Music] foreign [Music] pea is a fatty acid that is found naturally throughout the body it is a natural compound that your body produces in response to various forms of cellular damage its primary role is to promote homeostasis which is the body's ability to maintain a stable and balanced internal environment for optimal functioning and overall Wellness its unique ability to Target pain and inflammation provides a comprehensive approach to pain management gut health and neuroprotection let's hear more about the science behind p with Dr Danielle payamelli I've been tasked to introduce to you the science behind Palmetto ethanolamide pea and it's really a pleasure to do that this is a molecule that I find extremely exciting my lab has been working on this for over 20 years and I hope you will share my excitement by the time I am done with my with my talk I think the best way to introduce pea is just to remind ourselves of the history behind these exciting molecule um a history that actually starts a fairly long time ago in the 1940s when during the war when of course Pharmaceuticals were scarce it was discovered that egg yolk is an anti-inflammatory food and that Discovery brought scientists to ask the question what chemical component of egg yolk is responsible for the anti-inflammatory effects and scientists discovered that it was a lipid so it was not the protein it was not the the sugars but was rather the lipid component which of course in egg yolk is very abundant as you know and a few years later in 1957 tea which at the time was a novel lipid nobody had ever seen this structure in nature PA was isolated from egg yolk and it was shown to possess at least some of the anti-inflammatory effects that people had ascribed to egg yolk so not much happened after that a few papers in the 1960s researchers continue to confirm the anti-inflammatory effect of of pea but I think the big moment was when in the 1970s between 73 and 78 in the then country of Czechoslovakia which doesn't exist anymore now it's called Czech Republic in the Slovak Republic but in the country of Czechoslovakia there was a company called pufa and they developed pea for the treatment of influenza symptoms they call it impulsing and they run a clinical trial with it they actually ran a few clinical trials and this is the original paper published in 1974 in the European Journal clinical pharmacology and what they discovered I think was really interesting in fact you know in Palestine was as a result of these studies put on the market as an anti-influenza drug but what they discovered that it was really effective as you can see here maybe those of you are in the back won't be able to see it but in reducing some of the symptoms like fever headache and sore throat a lot more than others which are more allergic symptoms like nasal stuffiness discharge and cough but fever headache and sore throat were significantly reduced now meanwhile back in the lab people were starting to pay attention to pea and the discovery they think really matters here was done in a lab at the NIH um the lab of Sydney udem friend may not mean anything to you means a lot to me it was a very famous and accomplished investigator and this yeah this man here Nick batur was responsible for his study where they looked for fatty acid ethanolamites like Pea in mammalian tissues and what they found is indeed that the body of mammalians mammals mammalian animals produces pea these are in this table you again you won't probably be able to see it but it shows the levels of the endogenous levels of pea in a variety of tissues from Rats the brain the lung the liver and although the techniques back then were not very performing um they didn't have mass spec as we do now they were essentially right in that pea is indeed present normally in our body in Fairly large concentrations and in fact the conclusion that came from this study was obviously that PA people knew is anti-inflammatory now the discovery was made that is produced by in in our tissues so turns out the PA is an endogenous anti-inflammatory compound so that's an important Discovery why is that important because when we think about inflammation for many many years we thought about inflammation as follows we have a stimulus which is a pro-inflammatory stimulus and this for inflammatory stimulus causes the body to produce inflammatory molecules then the stimulus goes away and the inflammatory molecules slowly go away so whereas inflammation is seen as a positive response is a response is an active response is always seen as a response that causes the formation of something that is harmful to the body a pro-inflammatory compound instead what we have here is something that works in an opposite direction an anti-inflammatory compound so that's it very novel idea the problem is how does it work the first thought as to how it might work came actually from the work of a person whose photograph is here her name is and she received the Nobel Prize in 1986 for unrelated reasons she discovered something called the nerve growth factors which is a very very important molecule in regulating the the growth of for example sympathetic sympathetic neurons and you know this is a picture of her I met her and known him for many years when she was 102. very very healthy uh young woman here anyway so in the 1980s and early 1990s Rita was working on mast cells because also called mastocytes mast cells I'll tell you in a minute what they are because she discovered that they make nerve growth factor they make ngf so she was working on these mast cells and members of her lab came up with a possible explanation for what PA might be doing so these are the three people who I'm referring to of course Rita is right here and Luigi Aloha and Alberta Leon were the two co-workers who came up with this idea so this is a mast cell look this is a cell membrane this is the nucleus do you see all these little thingamajiggers here these vesicles they're full of stuff these are actually full of signaling molecules like serotonin histamine pro-inflammatory molecules so when mast cells get stimulated usually by antigens what happens is that they release these pro-inflammatory molecules and causing inflammation contributing to the inflammatory response and particularly continue to do itch providers which is one of the things that muscles do very very well so what Luigi Alberta and Rita montalcini did they thought wait a minute we have pea in the body let's see what happens if we give PA to mast cells in culture and what they discovered is that PA blocks the release of these inflammatory factors I told you before when we used to think about inflammation we used to think about something that is induced by viruses by bacteria when they arrive into the body we start producing molecules that are pro-inflammatory but PA doesn't work that way what what happens is that Pas normally very high in healthy cells there are many many molecules of PA we say macromolar levels of pea in the body for example in the skin for example in the drgs which are the dorsal or ganglil neurons in the macrophages a lot of pea what happens is that when a stimulus arrives one of these pro-inflammatory stimuli I just mentioned what happens is that the levels of PA drop precipitously they decrease this is just to show you data I don't want to just show you cartoons this is a data from the lab a piece of data from the lab these are the levels of pea in peripheral inflammatory cells if we give a compound called carrageenan which is a pro-inflammatory stimulus look the levels of PA drop precipitously so PA does not work like the rest of the of the mediators of inflammation and not let's not increase with inflammation it decreases with inflammation that's a very very important thing how does that exactly work okay here is how we think it works in healthy tissues there is a lot of pea and the enzyme that makes pea is this enzyme here called nape pld and what this enzyme does it cuts a lipid a large lipid we have on our cells called nape and then PA can be converted by another enzyme can be destroyed deactivated by another enzyme called Na and Triple A into this molecule here palmitic acid this is in healthy tissue a lot of pea in inflammation and in in painful States look PA is much less I told you that right why well because the enzyme that makes it an apld goes down the expression of this enzyme we say the transcription is down regulated and the expression of the enzyme that makes the destroys PA making palmitic acid is increased so it's a double whammy the less production more degradation less PA so who cares we do we should care because if inflammation and tissue damage lower PA production then by replacing the PA that we have lost inflammation we will have an analgesic and anti-inflammatory effects administration of exogenous PA can offset this deficit so we are giving a vitamin to a tissue that suffers from hypovitaminosis that is a very important concept it's not the same thing as giving a drug is restoring a normal level of an endogenous anti-inflammatory agent an analgesic agent so does it really work in humans I only show you data from rats mice and and stuff like that it does in fact I'm not a clinical investigator but I've been facilitated in this by the you know this very recent 2017 paper published by a group in Israel a meat meta-analysis of the efficacy of pea these investigators looked back at the literature and asked the question okay how many studies how many clinical studies we have on pea and compare the results that's called the meta-analysis and what they found they found 10 studies eight of which they were included in their report I will spare you the Gory details I'll just go to Quick conclusions pea they concluded maybe a useful treatment for pain and is generally well tolerated that's a very important initial initial clinical support of the idea that PA is an endogenous anti um analgesic and anti-inflammatory compound now of course the authors also concludes that more studies are needed and that's clearly clearly always the case so I would like to conclude this is my last um almost my last slide I'd like to conclude by bringing in a very important concept which is the difference between acute inflammation and chronic inflammation so acute inflammation is the type of inflammation which we have whenever our body is subjected to some kind of harmful stimulus for example a frostbite for example a cut a little infection causes inflammation it's a very protective response we need inflammation if we do not have an inflammation we would die that is acute inflammation and usually acute inflammation is rarely treated from ecologically treated I mean if you have an allergic reaction maybe you take an antihistamine but in most cases for these things unless they're very very serious you don't really go for a full treatment I mean maybe certainly an infection you do but you typically don't treat inflammation for example for an infection you treat the infection right you take an antibiotic you don't try and block the inflammation because the inflammation is a response to the to the arrival of the bacteria right so this is something that also can happen in a lot of normal situations they are not really pathological venkatesh was referring before to what happens when you run you know if you're if you're an athlete and you run or you you know exert your muscles excessively then you have lactate my globin release those are all things that that occur normally they're not considered diseases they're not pathological still they can be harmful right hurtful so that's acute inflammation and is very useful in survival what about chronic inflammation this is where scientists are baffled we do not know how an acute inflammation converts transforms itself into a chronic inflammatory condition where there is no more reason for the body to be inflamed there is no more reason for that there are known bacteria there are no viruses is just a process that is self-generating self-regenerating process and it's at the basis of almost every important disorder that we have cardiovascular disease rheumatoid arthritis autoimmune disease Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease these are huge conditions and of course cancer so chronic inflammation is I think Time Magazine once called it the silent killer now what does PA do in this context well what we know is that PA particularly in chloric inflammatory conditions and this has been shown in human tissue is lower just like I told you just like I told you the enzyme that makes it goes down the enzyme that destroysis goes up PA levels drop in allergic reactions rheumatoid arthritis and neurological diseases and of course we need more data we need more conditions we need to understand this better but this is where we are right now so if this is the case what this suggests is that of course if we therapeutic agents that for chronic inflammation should find ways of raising the levels of pea for example pea itself or agents that raise it through some other mechanism for example my lab is interested in developing inhibitors for the enzyme that destroys pea and those Inhibitors are very good at increasing the levels of pea but this is a drug what about instead healthy living and that's where I think you know my colleagues that leverage income with levogen and Gene core come in in in into play what they're what they're asking is the question is whether in conditions are not yet pathological PA could be also effective and they're sure they've just shown some very convincing data that this might be the case so I I will stop this by saying that of course we need more studies because this is despite the fact that 50 years as PA was discovered more than 70 years ago uh actually no more about 60 years ago in 57 um we still need to understand in Greater detail how it works in healthy people as well as in people with chronic inflammation or with chronic pain but the data we have so far are really encouraging [Music] [Applause] [Music]
