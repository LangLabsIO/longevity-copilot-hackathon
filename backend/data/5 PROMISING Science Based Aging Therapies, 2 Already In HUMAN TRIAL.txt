[Music] move on and tell you really really briefly about our daughter companies and what they're up to primarily about their sort of lead asset and I'm starting I'm just doing this in an order and the order is that it's the one furthest along in in the clinic so the first tour in the clinic and the next three are well on their way so very briefly um endogenous retinitis Pigmentosa is a devastating familial multifactorial genetic disease and results in the loss of cells in the back of your eye that prevent you from seeing light and color there's lots of everything okay it's a terrible disease um 1.5 million people around the world are are getting this or have this and endogenous has developed uh using the AI tools to develop chemical libraries has develop some compounds that stimulate the the new growth of the retinal progenitor stem cells in the eye to repopulate the outer nuclear in a nuclear layer of the eye and these cells are able to regenerate into the correct rod and Cone cells in the eye which is which is pretty remarkable endogenous is now in a phase one stroke 2A Rising dose talk study with um a bunch of functional endpoints as well as readouts so they went in the in three months ago now they went to the clinic and so that's going to be a readout next year in in a disease where there really isn't a general or a generic way of treating that disease all the successful Therapies in the space are Gene therapies that Target a few percent of the whole RP population and we hope to be Gene agnostic or mutation Gene agnostic in that sense so Ann Berlin is the CEO of rejuvenate biomed and when I met Anne the first time as we were looking for early stage companies but we we saw this and we went to talk to Anne and and she showed us the data on the right hand side here and this is really impressive I know this because I was at Novartis and we had a sarcopenia program that that was I ended up not so impressive unfortunately and the bottom line is that Anne has an approach with her team um in Belgium where they simply look for combinations of known approved safe drugs and look for unanticipated effects in a worm screening platform and then move these things on into the relevant Mouse models in this particular case the first asset that's in a phase one B for acute encyclopenia is a combination of of Two drugs that on their own do very little in a mitochondrial mutant Mouse model of sarcopenia at doses that would be equivalent to not even the highest dose that you would be given to humans for those two drugs for their indications respectively but when you combine them they have remarkable effects on on running time of running speed of running everything else and more importantly they also improve muscle Force per unit area so number three this is now not yet clinical senescence Therapeutics I'm not sure any any portfolio biotech company should not have a senescence uh Target or asset in their portfolio Manuel Serrano is the co-founder of senescence Therapeutics along with Tim cash who runs runs this program in Barcelona and Tim worked with manoise lab you know that Manuel Serrano discovered that when you treat certain solid tumors with chemotherapies you induce the the some of the tumor cells evade the drug by becoming senescent and no longer being in the cell cycle and they contribute to all kinds of complications in these tumors and have been associated with metastasis so we have a monoclonal antibody against a cell surface Target that is expressed upon chemotherapy treatment in irrelevant tumor that's just some data here from a publication related targets are not massively up overexpressed upon chemotherapy induction and our antibody binds its receptor and makes these cells now susceptible to immune clearance by the normal immune system in the body so that's a and that's that's gone into CMC we're about 18 to 21 months away from the clinic let's see if we can we can keep that going so it's a very exciting project from Manuel's lab in the background there we have multiple more targets for the same kind of mechanism that we're working on to validate and we also have a platform for senescent cells in CKD running uh number four yes number four telomere Therapeutics um you've just heard a wonderful talk by ferbitzier about uh restoring telomeres or preventing DNA damage by DNA damage along telomeres we have a slightly different mechanism of action here that we've discovered or sorry I should say our co-founder has discovered and basically um our co-founders discovered that when you delete a particular Target in in patient-derived ipscs from telomeropathy diseases he can restore telomere length to their more or less normal size without making them get any longer either and so we know about this Target and we know that there are compounds out there that that hit this target at least they may hit other things as well and so we're simply optimizing our compounds for this target for clinical trials in in a rare disease indication to do with telomeropathies the idea here of course is to expand into diseases that you've just seen on for a those fabrizio's slide very well that are associated with telomere damage in some way fifth last but most definitely not the least some people might call this slightly more moonshot style it comes with a bit more risk but I actually really really like this project it could be the most exciting of all it's going to take a longer Road as we all age our blood-brain barrier decays and so we are that that BBB decay causes a loss of proteostasis on on either side so things proteins metabolites get to where they shouldn't be on either side and things that should get to where they should don't necessarily get to the right place either one of the consequences of this altered protestasis either side of the blood-brain barrier is neuroinflammation and newer inflammation is bad because it causes cognitive decline dementia and the Thousand other diseases that are all lumped together here in this space And so there's a whole set of diseases called the cerebral small vessel diseases which are all somehow attributable to basically a damaged blood-brain barrier so we took powerbios Mouse data from Lee rubin's lab who is the co-founder of vascular Therapeutics and we looked for all the genes that went from Young Old parabolouses up down up or down up down depending on how you want to look at it and we simply made a very small chemical Library against all the gene products of the things that changed and related Pathways that changed and screened a blood-brain barrier model in vitro so we've got a very high hit rate and some of our hits are already submicromolar in our cellular assay and so we're now in validation of those hits and we're investigating relatively complicated but really quite useful animal models to prove our proof of concept for this particular story this will be a tougher route
