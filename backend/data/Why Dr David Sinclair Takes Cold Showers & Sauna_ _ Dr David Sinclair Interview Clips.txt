foreign [Music] cryotherapy actually get being cold you know because that that's that's another way for you to put your body in a good stress right so cornesis can be in many ways if it doesn't create lasting damage to your body you'll come out of the other side stronger okay so that you can do it with temperature as well now there hasn't been perfect controlled experiments about whether this really will make you live longer right that's that will take a long time but I've done the research in my lab and I've looked at other scientists and there's a lot of evidence that cold shock and sauna provide health benefits um and I love doing it anyway so what's the harm so the cold shock is is either having a cold shower or dunking into a cold bath sometimes with ice in it I don't like that one as much um I tend to just go into a cold pool at the gym which is about four degrees Celsius it's enough to make you clench but it you get used to it I do that only for I go underwater I dunk my head I'm in there for maybe a minute or two it's not I'm not gonna do an Iceman Hoff kind of thing and sit in there for too long but I think that's enough the sauna actually I really like and there's a lot of good studies out of the Nordic countries Norway in particular and Finland have studies where they they show that people who go to the sauna or in their houses have saunas uh tend to live longer and they have much better cardiovascular health and so I think that's wonderful you know it's after a workout I really like just sweating it out I feel great afterwards after that ice bath I come out feeling invigorated now now just a word of caution there is a study that says if you shock your body with cold after an intense bodybuilding workout it can reduce the benefits and I'm still trying to figure out exactly what that means um but because I the the weights and the cold baths are in the same facility uh it's not like I can just go home and come back another day so I do it all on the same day um yeah but that's all I can say that I'm still doing it until I'm totally convinced that it's not worth doing I know with your son you know a lot have you guys went to the gym you went to sauna steam room jacuzzi and then jumping in in a pool and and I'm unfortunate enough to have all of that in the house I have all of that in the house so I'm already planning now when it comes to getting the best benefits do you think that is best to to go from a very hot say for example a very hot location sauna jacuzzi to a cold pool or they're just beneficial separately one day I can just do so I know one day I can do pool yeah nobody knows that um we know that the sertolins are turned on by cold and we know that um there are benefits with heat nobody that I know of has done what you're asking which is test one to the other but theoretically it makes sense that the bigger the shock the better so that's what I do I go from sauna to steam room to call then into a hot tub and I think that's most likely to give me the benefits because you want to get your body out of its state of complacency um the modern world around us is built so that we don't feel any discomfort the chairs are comfy the lounges are comfy we get in cars even our our luggage has wheels now can life get any easier seriously we never have to go hungry usually and so our bodies are like yeah times are good we don't need to fight back but over a decades you end up with a body that starts falling apart getting diseases and is shorter lived then if you trick the body into thinking the times were tough right [Music]
