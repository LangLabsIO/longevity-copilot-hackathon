[Music] probably our favorite intervention to promote healthy aging certainly the most evidence-based intervention that we have and that's exercise where we are kind of exercise evangelists and even before our understanding of senescence um really its ability to counter many of the different forms of age-related cellular and molecular damage and there's some evidence and some of it might be controversial about exercise being able to prevent DNA damage or promote DNA repair clearly restoring me system mitochondrial health and function stimulating autophagy and encountering inflammation and strong evidence there then we think about the accumulation of senescent cells with advancing age we think a lot of that has to do with this unhealthy cellular milieu where immune function is compromised for identifying and deleting those senescent cells from a tissue and we think exercise may play a role in promoting the clearance of these cells and ultimately having an impact on how many synescent cells we emulate throughout the life course and in turn preventing the onset of a host of age-related conditions that I've referenced throughout the talk and I'll just show you a very simple example is almost a study of convenience that we were fortunate to work on we have an active older adults program at our our work place and this was a study of 30 individuals that were 60 years of age or older relatively healthy I would say because they were participating in an active exercise program so we assessed them before they started the program and afterwards and in response to this program not surprisingly we saw improvements in strength reductions in the time it took to do repeated chair stands doing standard clinical measures of function such as a timed up and go test we see improvements there in these individuals and importantly of course patient reported outcomes of fatigue and well-being and quality life also improved in response to this intervention and we took advantage of Ned sharpless's assay where he isolates CD3 positive T cells from the circulation as a biomarker of senescence these cells are enriched for p16 so they're a little bit better in terms of signal to noise ratio for for assessing senescence you know signals if you will and what you can see here is that uh we saw a pretty consistent reduction in many of the markers of not only just p16 signals and p21 signals but activation of the sea gas staying signaling pathway in these individuals just 12 weeks after they've participated in the exercise program and and of course um I can't claim that we reprogrammed the cells but that's one possibility or maybe there's kind of Rejuvenation of these cells and these are a different cell you know new cells that are are measuring here in these exercised individuals but I think it's a cool proof of concept um and I'll kind of add one more example of a lifestyle intervention we've just finished the analysis and we're putting together the story on calorie so zaira Versa postdoc in my lab has been hard at work on this study where calories a very fascinating study it's the only kind of two-year longitudinal study in humans a caloric restriction about 200 participants randomized two to one two to caloric restriction for every one person assigned to an ad liberative diet the goal was to 25 reduction over the course of two years the average is about 12 percent so if you think about it it's not dramatic right but it's it's probably a meaningful amount of reduction uh clearly conferred or conveyed many health benefits and cardiovascular risk in metabolic improvements and we've looked at about 30 different biomarkers of senescence and we see about half of them are positively affected even these younger healthy individuals um in terms of the circulating abundance of different biomarkers that we're interested in and these are a little bit complicated graphs because their measures have changed not necessarily abundance um but showing a significant effect of chloric restriction on the right hand side we took advantage of some data from Deep Dixit where he had a nice paper of doing RNA sequencing on the added to post tissue of individuals who just participated in the caloric restriction arm and you can see when we use this kind of Gene set that we recently published for senescence called sen Mayo we see a relative enrichment at Baseline compared to 12 months and Baseline compared to 24 months in individual also under when clerk restrictions suggesting that some of these different features of the molecular signature of senescence are benefiting in the adipose tissue at these relatively young middle aged individuals [Music] all right
