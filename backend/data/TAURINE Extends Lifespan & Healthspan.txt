[Music] story from the centenarians of okav islands I like it's in Japan uh those of you who don't know about this Islands this island holds the record of being a home of U maximum number of centenarians uh per capita in the world and uh according to a very interesting case study uh the secret of their longevity actually lies in their diet and and the diet is actually um like very much like like the diet has like too much toine in it and that's a parallel between this story in my research so uh what is toine U so um toine is basically uh um semi essential micronutrient it was discovered by two German scientists uh Frederick rman and leopard gin in 1827 from uh Ox Bull and that's why it names as toine from Taurus uh toine is basically uh it's basically present in Animal based product and it's not almost negligibly present in plants and the reason is uh the the enzyme that is responsible for toin synthesis pathway so if you see here the 16 sulfonic acid is required to convert toine from cine methionine pathway and this is actually deficient in plants and that's why plantbased diet has almost negligible toine content the the story of actually toine function is even more interesting so it was discovered in 1827 but for 100 years nobody knows you know what is the function of dorine so like around the like uh when the World War II ends uh there was Improvement in socioeconomic development people like the society get more affluent and uh people need to go to work they need Pet Foods so indust introduced this cat foods and what they identified that the with the introduction of these cat foods uh suddenly cats show blindness and they are like hitting to the walls and you know showing blind uh Behavior so so Society fund the research and uh they hired you know scientists to see like what is happening and scientists identified that actually this cat food diet uh lacks a very essential nutrient in in that uh cat food which is toine and they supplement that cat foot with the toine and they identify like they they they figured out like a 100% recovery of this phenomena and that study was published in science in I think in 18 1975 almost 150 years after the discovery of toine and 10 years after that another U story published in science again uh in 10 years showing the the importance of Tory in myocardial failure or cardiac functions so first we basically checked the correlation between T and uh like normal chronological age and we identifi there is a positive uh there is a very significant uh correlation next from the Epic norol study we identified that actually uh humans with toin deficiency have um like very significant correlation with the age Associated diseases and it's not only that if you if you see like uh if you see other metabolites related toin like hypo tarine they also show the similar kind of trend then what happens in the healthy condition we Al we all know exercise is good for us so uh this is a data from heading rage Labs our collaborator and he actually identified that even like different uh kind of people whether they are sedentary natural bodybuilders endural athletes or normal sprinters even if they do a short bout of graded exercise they show an increase in their toing level so all these things are you know correlations and we we know that you know um correlation doesn't always mean coition so the question is whether toine deficiency is just a passenger or a driver of Aging so to test that we use multiple species model first we confirm whether the similar trend is present in mice or not and after that we started supplementing uh mice with toine with 1,000 mg per kg body weight of dosage and we identified both in Fe Fales and male there was a significant increase in their median lifespan in females it was approximately 12% in males it was around 10% we also because the enzymes uh uh responsible for toin synthesis is actually very much conserved in at least in multicellular organism so we we see what happens with the toine supplementation in other model system so as you can see uh toine supplementation at least in higher doses increase lifespan in cigance but there is no difference in in the east and that is possibly because the enzymes respon like it may be responsible for the uh the difference in toine metabolism because the enzyme responsible for the synthesis actually um diverged way before in the evolution evolutionary tree so so we supplemented mice with toine and this time we use two different doses 500 mg per kg body weight and 1,000 mg per kg body weight and we identify like a slight reduction in their body weight and maybe that is due to the reduction in gonadal fat pad which was observed in previous studies as well and uh here you can see and I I love this data a lot because you can see that there is like almost 1.5 time increase in body uh bone density in these mice uh not only in the vertebra but also in the skeleton we also performed the stiffness analysis like femur maximum load and by three point B test analysis and the both the uh BS from the toin treated might show positive effect we also test working memory via V Maze and the T treated mice for the per performed way better for glucose homeostasis We performed gtt and it and as you can see in both the conditions T treated mice were healthier compared to the uh control treated mice so in summary uh we identified that toin supplementation makes animal healthier U Maybe by affecting like multiple Hall marks of aging and uh at least it show lifespan extension in worm and mouse and we also know that it associated with Torin deficiency is associated with poor health in humans but the missing piece in this study is the randomized clinical trial which is required before somebody should start taking Red Bull so I would like to acknowledge all the collaborators at funding agencies uh for this work and it's it's amazing like how collaborative the Aging field is and how helpful they are for conducting this [Music] study [Music] n
