[Music] collagen can we address a really common question and it's whether or not taking your supplements breaks your fast a very very common question and is it okay to take supplements on an empty diet on an empty stomach um well good two good questions so having experimented on myself for over a decade i don't see that drinking a little bit of just add water or taking a couple of spoonfuls maybe three teaspoons of coconut-based yogurt in the morning with my polyphenols resveratrol question physique and other three ones i mainly do i don't see them as breaking it fast okay and having watched myself and measured myself it doesn't do any harm um and it's actually necessary for me to get through the day and you do what's necessary okay and um and so while i may have a little bit of protein in my body from the yogurt and from just that water it goes away pretty quickly and my blood sugar doesn't go up which is my main goal the blood sugar levels are the key really yeah um you don't want those spikes in the morning and then you get hungry get lunch time and then you eat again that'll make you energetic and then a brain fog and be tired and then you hungry again that cycle is i've done that most of my life and it's a nightmare now that i have my lifestyle and the type of foods i eat i power through the day and my glucose levels are steady because my liver is much smarter putting out glucose than my eyes and my mouth are and and let your liver take care of you during the day and then feed yourself later in the day that's my advice yeah and there's you know and i think if you can wait until you are you are having a bit of food in your diet and you're not taking supplements that have to be taken earlier in the day it may be wait and take it then so you're not on an empty stomach uh and it also sounds like you sometimes you have to sort of experiment as well i don't have a problem taking supplements on an empty stomach i take my supplements with my matcha you know in the morning and and my tummy is fine i have no problems with it but that's my body so everyone's body's a little bit yeah i don't like taking supplements on an empty stomach usually because especially at night they sit in my stomach and make me feel this sick and i don't sleep that well right um so i like to have them i have some in the morning and then before bed i have some but i try not to eat them take them too late and that's worked much better for me somebody said something important which is breaking a fast is different to breaking ketosis ketosis is when your body switch from using carbohydrates uh to protein and fat for energy mainly fat and um my body doesn't change that i'm still in ketosis even if i eat a tiny bit of food or a little bit of the nutritious drink yeah yeah and i that's such a something really good to point out as we were talking about as we were talking earlier when it comes to fasting um i know that ketosis is a goal but again for women you want to be mindful because if you're in ketosis and extreme ketosis for too long a period of time then you'll produce more reverse t3 which can affect your thyroid it affects your hormones and so um for the women out there just just be a little bit more mindful about it and check your body and check your levels if you are kind of implementing fasting into your lifestyle and how long you fast and when you fast during the time of the month uh and and um and also know that during different weeks of the month you do want to incorporate certain say like um uh starches resistant starches some carbohydrate carbohydrates that are good for you when you are fasting during your eating window [Music] you
