[Music] whatever we do it has to be very well scientifically thought out but also proven and tested which is the key part that's missing with a lot of supplements a lot of supplements make a lot of claims but don't have any evidence in humans to back it up so we initially did a pilot study we wanted to check is it increasing NAD is it acting on the pathways that we wanted it to activate and and we confirmed this so that was back in 2019 and and then I was like okay so we know we have a formulation that works and it's stable let's do a bigger clinical trial so we started a double-blinded placebo-controlled crossover study which in you know the world of Trials is a gold standard trial in terms of design and we have 20 28 people enrolled the the the people that we were enrolled were between age 20 to 80 see and there were also male and female and which is really unusual because obviously a lot of clinical trials you have to only use a very specific age group and usually men just to try and eliminate any other factors but for me I was like I want this child to be as representative as the real world because this supplement is going to go into the real world so we need to know it works in a normal population of people what did we actually find in this trial well the first obvious thing to measure was NAD levels and it was found that after 28 days supplementation with material time plus NAD levels were significantly increased in the participants compared to when they were taking the placebo capsules during the clinical trial we also measured NAD at weekly intervals and the Cheeto time plus was found to it significantly increase NAD levels after only seven days supplement the next thing we wanted to find out was was our formulation actually fixing one of the main root causes of NAD Decline and switching back on that all-important nampt enzyme so what causes NAD to decline well there are known to be two main issues the first is the main enzyme in the cellular pathway that makes and recycles the majority of your NAD actually declines with age and this is a problem because nampt is what we call a rate limit in enzyme which means that the amount of NAD produced is directly dependent on the amount of this enzyme so when levels of nampt decline with age this means as NAD is used up by cellular processes it's broken down in a nicotinamide but this nicotinamide can no longer be recycled back into NAD again and this causes NAD levels to ultimately decline so nichiro time plus was found to significantly increase the amount of the nampt enzyme in the cells of the participants this means that Nitro time plus actually addresses the root cause of NAD Decline and switches back on your cell's natural NAD production pathway this is why we call an aceto time plus a second generation NAD booster and the Cheeto time plus is the only supplement that has been proven to boost levels of this key NAD production enzyme in a human clinical study the clinical trial also demonstrated that in a Cheeto time plus led to increased amounts of the key longevity protein cert 1 in the cells of the participants this is significant because as mentioned earlier NAD plus and sit on the situent pathway is considered one of the key pillars of longevity because together they activate so many other important Pathways that promote cellular health and like NAD the search ruins are found in every cell in the body so increase insertion activity has whole body benefits another key finding of the study was the effect that The Tutor Time plus had on inflammation so we know that inflammation is a normal part of a healthy immune system but we now also know that as we get older our immune system seems to become chronically over activated meaning it produces inflammation even when it isn't needed this excess inflammation causes damage to cells tissues and organs preventing them from functioning optimally in fact we now know that this chronic inflammation is a major driver of the aging process so much so that science is now referred to it as inflammaging therefore preventing and reducing chronic inflammation is critical to aging well in our clinical trial as well as boosting NAD levels the Cheeto time plus was found to reduce levels of the inflammatory cytokines il2 il5 and il-23 the Cheeto time plus was found to reduce levels of glycation in the participants glycation is an irreversible reaction with sugar molecules get stuck onto proteins within our cells this causes symptoms stiffen and change shape preventing them from functioning correctly a really classic example of this is when collagen and elastin proteins in the skin become glycated and this causes the skin to form to lose its firmness and elasticity and causes wrinkles and this is why sugar is bad for aging in our clinical trial we measured participants levels of glycated serum proteins and found that the Cheeto time plus reduced glycation following 28 days of supplementation this is because NAD is known to activate a protein recycling pathway called autophagy which can help remove damaged proteins from the body another thing that we were interested in measuring was biological age your biological age is the rate at which you are aging on the inside it's how well your cells are functioning and how much damage they have accumulated in the trial biological age was measured using a test called glyconage which was taken before and after supplementation glycanage calculates the biological age by looking at the patterns of sugar molecules on immune cells which change in a predictable way with age in our clinical study the tutor tampus was found to reduce biological age by an average of 1.26 years after only 28 days of supplementation and finally even though all the ingredients in our supplement are known to be safe and well tolerated some standard liver function tests were also included to further ensure product safety and it was found that there were no significant differences between the placebo and The Tutor Time plus indicate no Toxic effect on liver function and that the supplement is safe and well tolerated so just to summarize in a randomized double-blind placebo-controlled crossover study nitito time plus was found to significantly increased cellular NAD after only seven days it works by switching back on youthful cellular NAD production by reactivating a key enzyme in the Salvage pathway it was fun to increase the longevity protein so one to reduce levels of the inflammatory cytokines indicating that NAD is being directed towards beneficial processes rather than inflammatory cd38 it was found to reduce glycation and also reverse biological age foreign [Music]
