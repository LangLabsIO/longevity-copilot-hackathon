[Music] the future um besides chronic mental stress that's not good for you but biological stress making your muscles a little bit concerned or your brain this is called hormesis uh think of hormesis as what doesn't kill you makes you stronger and we have these defenses the genes that we work on are called sirtuins there are seven of those genes in our body they're found in all life forms even plants and there are other longevity genes there's one called mtor which senses amino acids and protein and then there's a third main pathway called ampk which the drug metformin a diabetes drug works on and together those three pathways will sense whether you're in trouble so how do you fool your body into thinking times are not easy times could be tough well one is we talk about eating less eating less tells your body wow we might be running out of food that's pretty easy turns on defenses running mimics getting chased by another tribe or a saber-toothed tiger that's pretty good lifting weights is another way i i do mostly that i go to the gym a few times a week and work out and stretch and just make sure that my my muscles don't atrophy that's essential for a mobility and safety in older age type of food you eat is important uh for instance olive oil so olive oil you know you can roll your eyes yet and it's in the mediterranean diet it's in uh it's in salad dressings but what has been found molecularly is that it activates a particular defensive enzyme that we work on called cert one one of these sirtuins the same way that the red wine molecule resveratrol works i'll show you so this is a typical breakfast for me it's a couple of spoonfuls of of low-fat yogurt uh plain yogurt with some resveratrol and some nmn thrown in i could have very well eaten a spoonful of olive oil and probably had a similar effect so those kinds of things in your mediterranean diet those plant-based molecules are also telling your body times might be tough now you might might ask why would olive oil tell your body that times could be tough well it turns out that oleic acid which is in olive oil is also generated by our own bodies when we're hungry when our fat breaks down we make oleic acid and that's the signal for our bodies to fight disease and we're just lucky that it's also found in foods that we like [Music] [Applause] [Music] you
