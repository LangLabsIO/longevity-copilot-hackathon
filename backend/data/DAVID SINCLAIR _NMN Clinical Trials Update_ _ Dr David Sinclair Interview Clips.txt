[Music] so uh so by reading your research on uhd and it's precursors um mm uh well it's really amazing and the result is really amazing and i think a lot of people benefit from it i'm wondering is just by calculation from the research it's a pretty large amount of money needed for human so uh because and this is endogenous molecules if we supplement it largely to body daily would that cause kind of desensitization of body to uh or its downstream factors which leads to people need to have all the mice need to have more and more over the years well it it doesn't seem so we give the same dose to the mice throughout their old age um and they're less frail and we've got early evidence that we've got more mice on the way that it extends lifespan but that's that's just early days i don't want you to uh tweet that one but uh the point is that those mice are not losing their ability to turn nmn into nad as far as we can tell in the clinical trials we've done at least a month of treatment i think we've got now got some three-month data uh over that time frame in humans nad levels uh go up with nmn if you take a gram or two grams a day about two-fold in the blood and in the blood cells and they don't come back down so i i think and we've done dogs as well that's preliminary but it looks like uh dogs maintain their nad levels as well for a few months at least uh so yeah i don't think there's anything to worry about in that regard what i think is more likely is that we need to time it right because energy levels are cycling during the day in the circadian rhythm you don't want to mess up your sleep patterns that can also apparently age you uh but also we want to know how often do you need to take these nad boosters and as far as i know nobody's tried that even in a mouse to try every other day or two times a week um just for lack of money and time but i think those experiments would be great thank you i think yeah i think it's very complex this thing in the in the body about of the decentralization and i think a lot of them signaling are very robust and they won't be really affected by external agents od and asking is there any uh clinical trial for madman in the past few years i think there are lots of them but could you please briefly elaborate it uh yeah i mean the ones i know the results of um there are lots of them that are being put on the clinical trials.org but um the trials that i've been affiliated with um and in full disclosure it's a company i started called metrobiotech they have nmn being dosed to patients that have friedreich's ataxia a rare disease from neurological mitochondrial disorder we also have trials in covet 30 hospitals and then also for at the brigham and women's hospital they're testing muscle endurance and strength and so those are the trials we've been doing phase one safety studies for close to three years now in people with uh brigham women's hospital group and have had no issues in those patients or those subjects so that's all i have to report for now but hopefully in a year from now i'll have some good news or some bad news to report well i would believe there were more and more research and clinical trial owners and we're looking for good news not bad news [Music] you
