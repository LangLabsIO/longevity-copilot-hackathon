over time your body just gets used to to having a good life and instead of putting its efforts into surviving it puts its efforts into growing and reproducing and making more fat and storing things up for for when times get tough and unfortunately in today's society times really never get tough we have to effectively make our bodies do tough things uh anyway so so our lifestyle is killing us and now we know why so what what about these activators how do you if you don't want to run a marathon every day and if you're too sick to be on a treadmill what are you going to do and and not only that how do you augment a healthy lifestyle with molecules and what we've realized is that there are a couple of ways to do it one is to boot to boost up the levels of a molecule that we naturally make called nad that the sirtuin enzymes need for activity and the other is to ingest molecules that plants make to survive and one of those that's become famous is resveratrol that's from grapes and found in red wine in small quantities and those are the two ways and they work by different mechanisms resveratrol is the accelerator pedal for these enzymes and nad is the gas or the petrol the fuel when we add both sortunes work even better and so that's why i've been on resver taking resveratrol and nad boosters for many years now because the science points to them being additive in the body so nad is interesting uh we learnt about this in biology in high school and probably fell asleep but the good news is actually that we we've now realized that nad isn't just part of biochemistry and the tca cycle it's actually important for survival as well and the body through the sortuans is sensing uh the levels of nad and so levels of nad will go up in an animal and i i think we've shown in humans now that when you exercise when you're hungry it goes up and those are signals to the sirtuins that times are going to be tough and so by taking an nad precursor that like i do and my father does uh my wife my our pets um we don't think it's unsafe because this is a natural molecule that we make anyway when especially when we're young and we're fit we think that we're going to trick the body into thinking that times are tough and that we're young again and stabilize the epigenome and repair dna in a way that i used to when i was when i was 20. um and actually you might be wondering how much does nad decline between 20 and 50 years of age and at least based on skin samples it's about 50 decline which is horrible if it's true but it's pretty easy to boost up levels in in people we've done clinical trials now and others have done the same and uh doubling nad levels is actually not that hard one dose is not going to help but over the matter over about a week or two uh those levels go up i haven't tested myself though i haven't been uh doing that but but in studies of dozens of people it looks like the mouse results are pretty clear and when certains have more nad they're doing a better job of stabilizing the epigenome and keeping cells identity correct and also having the energy to repair dna as well and find their way back on
