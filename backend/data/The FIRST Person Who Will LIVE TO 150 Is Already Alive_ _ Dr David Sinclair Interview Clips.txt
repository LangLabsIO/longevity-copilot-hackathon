[Music] um well a bunch of questions but this one was intriguing is the person who's going to live to be 150 years old already maybe here in the audience or are born and then my correlator to that you know what what's the upper limit will ray kurzweil make it right i hope ray makes it yeah we all root for him right he's the poster boy for this he is uh well i think it's it's feasible that somebody could make it to 150 remember people born today will even if we don't succeed we'll still see the year what 21 20. that's a long way in the future a lot is going to happen in those years you know what were we doing 100 years ago we were learning how to fly and you know we didn't even have antibiotics so remember that that it's not today's technology that future or people living today will have they'll have uh things that we can't even dream of uh but you know i get i get criticized for saying that somebody could live 250 um but i would i also am of the belief that uh you should never say never uh i think it's feasible what i think is is really realistic is that more and more people are going to make it to 90 and 100 in a healthy way we tend to think you know we look at people who are 90 and 100 and think why would i ever ever want to reach that age but what we should remember is getting to that point first of all it means that you can be healthy 60 70 80 90 playing tennis hanging out with your great grandkids that's important so we're extending out the health span not just lifespan but perhaps those 900 year olds who make it there are going to be living much healthier lives and what's interesting is the mice that make it out there into that later life what we find is that they die more quickly so we're rectangularizing the mortality curve which is something that i think any sensible person would think is a good thing there was that study recently that said that humans is looking at statistics there's a pretty sharp cutoff in human longevity at about 120 years something like that and here's a french study is there any gist to that or uh yeah so the longest lived person and even that's debated is 122. there appears to be a barrier but none of these people had done anything except perhaps drink red wine and have a sense of humor we have better technology than that now so who knows what's possible maybe the humor gets better on that note thank you very much [Music] you
