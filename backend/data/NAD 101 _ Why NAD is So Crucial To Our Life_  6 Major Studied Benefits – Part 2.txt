[Music] foreign so first of all what is NAD and why is it actually so important so NAD is just a natural molecule that is found within every single cell of your body and it's so important within the cells that if you didn't have it you would actually be dead in 30 seconds and this is because it plays such a major role in energy production in the mitochondria where it helps turn the food that you eat into the cells that you into the energy that your cells need to function as well as its role in energy metabolism it's also been found to be incredibly important in cellular maintenance and repair and basically what I mean by this is it acts as a switch to actually switch on cellular maintenance and cellular repair processes on and off so when you've got high NAD levels basically you get more energy and you have more repairs processes switched on and when you've got low NAD levels you have generally less energy and less of the repair and maintenance processes are switched on within the cell so the problem that we have is that our NAD levels have actually been found to decline with age in fact cellular NAD levels are found to decline by around 50 percent every 20 years so when we're young you have really high levels but as you get older they Decline and this the problem with this is it basically makes it harder for your cells to sustain vital processes such as energy production DNA repair cellular maintenance and when NAD becomes persistently low when we're at Advanced stage this results in an accumulation of damage that basically leads to many of the symptoms of aging and negative Health consequences that are also associated with aging and just to show how much your NAD actually declines it's estimated that approximately you suffer from a decline of 50 percent in your NAD Levels by every 20 years and this is dropping from literally the day you were born so by the time you're 20 technically you've already lost 50 of your NAD so that's quite a big decrease even at this early stage in life foreign so the good news is that there is a lot of scientific evidence to show that actually you can boost your NAD levels and if you do do this you can have incredible health benefits as you age so Studies have shown that increasing NAD levels can do a host of benefits to the cells and to your health in general for example it's been shown to improve cellular energy levels it's been shown to restore muscle function improve cognitive function all of things that actually decline with age on a cellular level it's been found to repair damaged DNA it's also improved markers of insulin sensitivity and it's improved vascular function and cardiovascular protection and you know these are whole body-wide improvements here and it's not actually surprising that there are so many benefits because NAD is found in every single cell in your body and it's playing a critical role in all of these cells in some key studies that have taken place recently scientists working with NAD have discovered that by replacing NAD in age cells and tissues they could actually reverse age-related Decline and reverse any damage in the cells to a youthful state in other words that after they had treated the cells with NAD they could no longer tell the difference between the old and young tissues so many scientists actually now believe and agree that maintaining high levels of NAD as you age is actually a really promising way to combat the aging process [Music] mm-hmm
