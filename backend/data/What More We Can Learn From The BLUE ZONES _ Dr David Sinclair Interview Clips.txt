so [Music] the blue zones um yeah so i i totally agree that the science says that the environment is important your social environment your stress levels cortisol we measure i'm measuring my body i try to keep that low now it's it's very clear that the data says that you need a social environment to live really long now it can mean having a great partner you can rely on or if not or and have a pet that you come home to these are all shown to be great for longevity and actually there's a study that's worth noting which is that at harvard they followed these were men they followed them after world war one i think it was maybe it was world war ii anyway it was for their whole lifespan and looked at their health and the one thing that was in common with the people that lived a long time was to have a reliable partner and to me that that's striking you know it wasn't just what they ate how much they exercised it was the partner was important um so yeah i think being lonely really will accelerate aging places like blue the blue zones um let's make an assumption that most people they're very laid back they consume different food it's a very different lifestyle but there's also this sense that in these smaller communities there might not be the same media consumption that we have in north america or in europe or any of these any of these countries are on the continents where people almost get obsessed by media consumption which is raising cortisol levels and you become consumed by we saw it happen with the pandemic how much of what goes on in the blue zones do you think has to do with versus let's just say north america has to do with um longevity i think there's a lot to that that your cortisol levels and possibly other molecules we haven't discovered yet are circulating in your body when you're on this in this heightened uh fright or flight state which [Music] based on my my surveys of people that i meet reached its height um during the trump administration and the election and since then a lot of us including myself have called cold turkey on consumption of the news um and i've been just speaking for myself much healthier my cortisol levels have gone down um and my mental state is so much better i even talk slower than i used to i mean a more zen-like state but before it was oh my goodness how many people have died today what's going to happen world's going to blow that's not healthy at all and i i can easily imagine it to be true that that reduces the longevity of an entire country that's watching it versus or at least communities that that focus on it versus those that don't and what you hear also from people who live a long time is that they don't worry about things and they don't consume huge amounts of media and often they say it's their sense of humor that has gotten them through and that's a common theme with these uh centenarians and actually it's one of the few things that's common you know often they they smoke they drink they do bad things but being relaxed and having brushing off problems and not worrying is is one of the things that they all share [Music] [Applause] [Music] you
