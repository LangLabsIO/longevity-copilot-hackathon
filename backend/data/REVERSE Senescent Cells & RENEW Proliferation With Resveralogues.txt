[Music] and so we all know that there are many senolytics that kill senescent cells I work on something slightly tangential which is the reversal of sence and I look at situations in which it's possible desirable and I'll present one situation today where I think very strongly that it will prove to be essential and as a tool to help us with this we work for we've worked for a number of years with a molecule called Resveratrol and again this will not be a stranger to many people in this room in a typography of gero protectors evolved by a remarkably talented chemist Richard Hartley at Glasgow Resveratrol is what he refers to as a type 2 Network engaging drug that is a compound which interacts with multiple biochemical Networks Works each of them relatively weekly and as I've done here you can comb through the literature you can find multiple examples as Reser all doing different things if you use fairly standard bioinformatics like metacore you can see that those effects are almost certainly mediated by highly distinct Pathways so a drug that does everything not very well how can we sort the wheat from the chaf how can we unpack the functions that are important and the way in which we've chosen to do this was inspired by my collaborator Professor Lizzy oser who as many of you will know is also Mrs Richard farer because I'm one of those old-fashioned scientists who believe that plagurism begins at home and so what we've in fact done what Lizzie has done is developed a simple onepot synthetic root for these compounds she's made over 40 of them they dropped straight out most of them were completely novel the yields are excellent so it's very suitable for Library approaches and with a set of structural homologues you can do some quite interesting things you get series of compounds with controlled Network interactions this is just some of the data if you're interested I would direct you to the paper the top graph is activity against one of res tr's canonical targets are two in one and as you can see the compounds vary from being a little bit better than Resveratrol to being to doing nothing to being very much worse and in fact more potent Inhibitors than serinol with actually lower toxicity and what we did once we had the library was we looked to see what these red spogs would do to senescent cells and the reason we did this was because I was approached by a very talented lady profess Professor Lor Harry's who's in the bottom right hand corner on that slide is at the University of of exor and is now CEO of a company called sinisa Lor was interested and still is in RNA splicing and knew these compounds affected splicing factors and so what we did was we supplied a few of our compounds to Lor deliberately picking ones that had no activity against S one ones that had variable activities against c one and ones that had variable effects on the sasp ranging from quite good inhibition to leaving some up and standing and this is important for the next part of the story because what we wanted to do was make sure we could exclude paracrine suppression effects from senescent cells in the culture and with the five compounds we selected we found something quite impressive that res rosars will rescue sence and allow renewed proliferation so so at the appropriate dose senescent cells will re-enter the cell cycle they will begin to divide again this is associated with an extension of telm and they will continue to proliferate if you take the compound away the tmia shorten back down and they go back to sleep so that was I'd love to say that was an expected finding but it wasn't but it was good that it happened we knew they would do something and so we have our hands on a panalog compounds that can reverse replicative sence are they of use against other types of sence and the model that we decided to use was a type of therapy induced sence in equids there are several reasons for this one is that I'm very good friends with Roger Smith who's the gentle in whose lab this took place the other one is that tendonopathy is common with aging it causes severe morbid bidity in people it also causes severe morbidity in Performance Horses which means that treating tendonopathy is a commercially extremely sensitive area because there is that old old Bon Mo of how do you become a millionaire and you start off as a billionaire and get into racehorses okay and so we looked at The Superficial digital Flex attend and the fdft in these animals because it's the human Achilles both of those injuries are often treated with cortica steroids and this often does more harm than good because they suppress the inflammation but they also induce a senescent state and if you do it repeatedly the tendon gets worse not better and if these are data from equin Tina sites I hope what you can say using doses that are significantly below the doses you get in v o cortical steroids will sesse tentin aites that sence is associated with not regulation of the standard cdkis a restricted sasp that we term the easp and the upregulation of a range of mmps that will degrade the tendon this is not good news in a tendon the good news part of this story is that we are able to prevent therapy induced Sines by cortica steroids using compounds from our Reservoir log library in a way that is c one independent like the reversion effects at all because v29 a compound in our library does not interact with C oneor it doesn't activate it and so this hopefully would mean that we can improve outcomes where cortica steroids are used in tendon injury we're not the only people to be using these compounds a colleague Michael wormstone until very recently at the University of East Anglia is using the parent compound to treat posterior captal of pacification we're expecting to be able to dig into that and find out which pathways are involved whether they are the same or different in the PCO situation and the reason that we can do this is again because we have a compound Library um the screening system to pull out the pathways is very very straightforward we're doing that at the moment will probably have it completed within a few months and those results are not ready for prime time as they say and so I hope I've shown you that there are a couple of occasions where this might be desirable as well as simply possible I'm going to now show you one where I think reversing or protecting from sin Essence is going to be essential and this is in a slightly odd area for this community which is the field of bioartificial organs especially bioartificial liver systems there's a schematic of a bioartificial liver behind me and I'll show you a picture of the real device in a moment but all one needs to know is that the core of these systems are Hollow fiber cartridges containing hepg2 cells all right there's about 800 gr to a kilogram of Hep g2s in the cartridges and if you have liver failure as you probably know ammonia levels in your blood will go up albumin levels will go down the idea for a long time has been to plug sufferers into one of these devices their blood flows through the hollow fibers ammonia diffuses into the hepg2 cells which turn it into urea and secrete it back and they secrete albian as well they do other things like detoxify antibiotics there's a surprisingly large need for these systems mostly driven by the shortage of organs as many of you may be aware aging is a major risk factor for the development of liver disease but it's a bit of a onew punch because as the population ages we will start to see some problems increasing age is an independent predictor of poor transplant outcomes whether you're giving an organ or getting one and so we might end up with a situation where you have more people needing organs they're poor transplant um recipients and the organs they get might not be very good so anything that can be done would be useful um but people have been working on these bowels for some time and they always fail this is just a study from pigs something about the patients plasma causes the cells in the device to stop working properly and people have persevered in the way that people do and cut their trial data and cut their trial data these things have gone as far as um phase three where they failed epically and that's simply to show you what one of the devices look like the culprits are almost certainly a potent cocktail of endogenous hepatotoxins so I'm talking about things like ammonia biler Rubin bile salts and I was reading through this literature for reasons that don't matter and people were describing the phenotypes of the cells after exposure to Patient plasma and they were eerily reminiscent at least to me of celsin Ence which these guys had never heard of and with the help of an enormously talented first of all PhD student now I'm glad to say returning as a postdoc Dr Neda hadari we started to look at this in two and 3D culture systems and within within 6 hours in fact it's more like an hour or two hours exposure to a standard toxin cocktail in plasma wiess hpg2 cells and you can block that with resar logs when hepg2 cells are rendered senescent they do develop a sass but that doesn't matter because you're not hooked up to the patient for long enough what they do stop doing extraordinarily rapidly is making Ura we can block that with rosals and what they also do is they stop making albumin and we can prevent that as well and I think what we may be looking at here if you read around in the bioartificial organs area because people have been interested in making bioartificial kidneys as well we may be looking at one of the blocks in the road and we may be looking at the first attempt to bypass it and that would be good news for the artificial organs field if you're interested in some of these areas there's a little book chapter that we wrote which I would recommend to anybody and so just to conclude what I thought I hope I've shown you with a quick Whistle Stop tour through the data is that reversal of cence not really senis is possible in a variety of potential contexts that this toxin induced inessence that we've seen in the liver systems maybe an under recognized problem that has hampered the development of bioartificial organs much of the focus in the past has been on the bioengineering because that is not a minor challenge but that's been to the detriment of the cells in the system if this is the case and we're pretty sure it is we're hoping to go to a clinical trial in a couple of years reversal of sence is probably the only route you'll maintain organ function in those xvivo systems I hope I've also shown you that the creation of a compound series is one route to unpicking the Key activities of these type two drugs and you have seen kind of walk on performances by vets by bioengineers synthetic chemists and cell biologists and I think this shows the need for cross disciplinary work in our field [Music] I
