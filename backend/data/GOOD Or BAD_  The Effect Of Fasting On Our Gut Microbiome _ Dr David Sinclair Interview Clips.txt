[Music] most of our gut are bacteria and there's hundreds of species but that Al it also includes a microb is a is a fungus we have fungi in our gut um we have certain parasites as well and we have viruses and together um and there are even these very ancient bacteria called proteobacteria so it's a conglomerate of pretty much all microbial life forms uh of some sort or another in our guts and they work together as a community that's what a microb they're typically smaller than you can see with your eye in the case of a yeast cell if you put about 10 of them in a pile you can see a little dot that's how small they are your microbes make vitamins and molecules that are good for your health uh and even mimic uh things like exercise and dieting through creating compounds that leak into your or pass into your body uh things like ketone which can mimic fasting and give you the the healthy products that you need um and in fact without a microbiome uh we're very sick because we don't get those nutrients that we need people who who fast have a different type of microbiome that is generally healthier they have bacteria that like to process foods what's called satic metabolism which means they're not digesting protein they're like sugars but when they they turn that energy into keton so at acetate succinate these are metabolites that have to be used by mitochondria to generate energy in our body and they're super healthy and that they help uh with the fasting process and it's um think of it like if you if you drink vinegar it's similar to that your body becomes in that state and that's a very healthy State your mitochondria are super important for overall health in your brain your muscles they generate energy they make components for growth and by fasting your you will actually rev up the mitochondria and then your microbes will make the components that your microb that your mitochondria need for for good health so it's all a virtuous cycle of not always being full not always um giving your microbes what they need and in fact this is how we evolve this is what humans naturally want and it's what our our microbes and our gut naturally want they want to be able to compete for food and not just feed them all the time and that really can allow for the bad types of bacteria to proliferate and one thing about what makes a bad microbe well I've told you what's a good microb right it makes these butyrates and acetates and it makes vitamins and it's anti-inflammatory a bad one uh some eoli types for example they produce what's called LPS lipopolysaccharide and that little component gets into your system into your bloodstream and causes low grade inflammation in fact if you have a lot of you can get a fever it's that bad and that's what you want to avoid is to get that the LPS levels down and maintain a low inflame state in your [Music] body
