[Music] foreign to get started this is the general interest of my lab which is what causes aging and whether there's anything we can do to slow it down so to take someone with this sort of less successful aging trajectory on top and redirect them to a more successful aging trajectory on the bottom and the best way that we know how to do that right now at least experimentally in laboratory organisms is caloric restriction so this is a survival curve from a typical calorie restriction experiment where you just simply give the animals less calories it's female mice in this case and the inside curve here is the control group fed under normal conditions that you would raise mice under if you mildly restrict their calorie intake by about 10 you get this Alpha curve shown here in the Middle where you get a small but significant lifespan extension and then if you very severely restrict their calorie intake by about 50 of this particular experiment usually about 40 percent you get this pretty dramatic shift in the survival curve here where even even the luckiest animals in the control groups are dead before the majority of animals in the calorie restricted group so this could have a really profound effect on lifespan and it's really accepted at this point to say the calorie restriction really does affect something fundamental of about the aging process not just a few specific causes of death and so we've been generally interested in how this might work and in many different topics related to that and that was really the driving force for my lab to start thinking about NAD because this is one of the things that responds to calorie restriction of course there's many other routes to getting to NAD and many of the other labs that work on NAD never thought about it this particular way but for us it was these observations in papers like the ones shown here so this is skeletal muscle NAD content if mice have different ages so six months on the left here or 22 or 30 months which are much older mice near the end of their lifespan and you can see the muscles skeletal muscle NAD content is falling pretty dramatically and on the right hand side you can see that if you kind of restrict and then look at aged animals that that were kind of restricted versus not you can see that's restoring the the muscle dandap content and we see the same thing with exercise so there's generally a correlation between the NAD content of tissue and these interventions that promote Health and Longevity uh we've done some work in my own lab and collaboration with Joshua benowitz's now to look at NAD levels across a variety of tissues and so this is just data in our own hands showing that in many tissues NAD levels do seem to fall this is 25 month old mice compared to four-month-old mice and you can see in liver kidney and skeletal muscle in the quadriceps here we see decreases in NAD it's not Universal in our hands it's not so clear that it falls very much the pancreas or spleen or stomach but we do definitely see a decline in NAD levels in many tissues of age in mice and others have reported the same thing in humans they're sort of a growing body of literature on this now but clearly it's true in in the skin which was the first tissue reported for humans we were involved in this study with uh with colleagues here at Penn in ravender Reddy's lab who were able to show this correlation between NAD concentration in the brain and age by magnetic resonance and in liver biopsies from humans the same thing has been reported where uh the people over 60 have much lower NAD levels in the liver Than People Under 45. and so that's why we're interested in NAD and I think before we continue to show any more data on the subject of stop and remind everyone exactly what we're talking about which I possibly remember chemistry textbooks but it's this molecule shown here in the center nicotino might add mean by nucleotide that plays critical roles in redox metabolism and so that's shown on the right it's involved in things like glycolysis beta oxidation the tricoboxylic acid cycle where NAD accepts a hydride ion so electrons and an h plus to get reduced to nadh shown on the right and then that gets reoxidized by processes like donation to complex one of the electron transport chain to fuel mitochondria by the lactic dehydrogenase reaction or many other dehydrogenases that can use these electrons and different biochemical transformations and so that cycle is really fundamental to life we really have no sustainable route to generate ATP or to synthesize many macromolecules without having this ability to shift reducing power back and forth through NAD now on the left side I'm showing consumers of NAD which are more recently discovered they're important in their own right things like perps cd38s or twins which have critical signaling functions uh and regulate the certain different aspects of cellular physiology but importantly they actually consume The Entity backbone and release nicotinamide and so this necessitates a salvage Pathway to reset the size NAD from nicotinamide and it creates the possibility that these things can get out of whack and so the size of the NAD pool can change if the consumer activity gets upregulated inappropriately or for some reason Salvage synthesis is blocked and that affects both sides of the slide because once the NAD pool Falls then it's not no longer available for these redox reactions even though the redox reactions themselves don't consume the NAD they allow you to regenerate it and so even from what I've already said I think it's clear that NAD is completely essential for life if you don't have it that's going to be lethal we actually have human data to prove that because it turns out that a deficiency for NAD precursors is the cause of the disease pellagra which was endemic in the southern U.S in the early 1900s and leads to what was known as the 4ds dermatitis diarrhea dementia and death so if not treated this disease really can go on to to become fatal yeah even when you obviously still do have some NAD levels present in the body so this discovery that that pellegra is caused by an NAD deficiency is integrally uh related with the discovery of NAD in the first place and so I'll give you a little bit of history on that um starting with the discovery of co-ferment uh which was by Hardin and young in in 1906 they were doing experiments with oil yeast extracts where they discovered that there was a substance present in the yeast even after boiling that could accelerate the fermentation of alcohol they named it co-ferment not really knowing anything else about it at the time other than it was something that could survive boiling uh between 1914 and 1929 Joseph goldberger was active in trying to establish that palagra was a nutritional disorder it had been debated whether it was an infectious disease and then the cause hadn't been understood and he was actually able to demonstrate that if you improve the quality of the diet for people suffering from pellagra particularly adding meat and milk you could cure the disorder in the 1920s hands on Euler Shelton discovered that co-ferment is actually a nucleotide so the substance that can accelerate the fermentation of alcohol was something that had a nucleotide structure I'm still not knowing what it was Warburg and Christian went on to determine that it actually contains a nicotinamide which is what actually supports the redox reactions since nicotinamide when attached to a backbone is capable of accepting the hydride ion and finally Conrad Alpha Gem and colleagues put it all together at the end of the 1930s and were able to show that nicotinamide and nicotinic acid can prevent pellagra and contribute to the synthesis of this redox active nucleotide which which turns out to be NAD obviously uh and so that was a a real tour de force and established nicotinamide and nicotinic acid as vitamin B3 something essential that we need to to prevent the onset of pellagra and obviously uh facilitated curing this disease effectively in in Western countries that could afford the vitamin supplements so since then the the question that's been left to be answered is do the NAD levels still matter once you've avoided pellagra after the 1940s pretty much you were considered to have sufficient levels of NAD if you weren't suffering from pellagra and so it's really only recently that we've Revisited this question and asked whether there might be some benefit to boosting NAD levels in people that are apparently healthy and there's a few different reasons to think that might be the case one of them is that NAD levels are circadian and so at least in the liver and in several other tissues our body has seen fit to put a lot of effort into regulating the levels of nadosynthetic enzymes here on the top this is nicotinamide phosphoribosa transferase and the black Trace shows the the nice circadian rhythm in a wild-type liver the white dots show a clock mute so if you break up the circadian clock you also lose rhythmic expression of NAD biosynthetic enzymes and on the bottom you can see the result that the NAD levels are actually going up and down in the liver over a circadian Time Force in addition there's a growing body of literature showing that in humans NAD level doesn't just correlate with age but also with functional status and so really suggesting that there there might be a real benefit to having a little bit higher level of NAD even within the normal range and so the the large metabolomics graph over here on the left is just highlighting the fact that if you rank metabolites based on either the age or the functional status of individuals NAD really shows up as something that gets down regulated in either case either by age or functional status and stands out among all the other metabolites that were measured in this particular study the inset up here on the right makes another point which is that functional status really plays a critical role here so if you look in the older adults and then the three groups on the right you can see on average there's lower NAD levels and than in the younger adults as expected but if you look at exercise trained older adults here the second group their NAD levels in the muscle actually aren't even statistically significantly different from those young adults and so this is something that you could potentially modulate through through exercise and then healthier habits and it's something that that really reflects the functional status much more than the age per se foreign [Music]
