[Music] so [Music] so can you just get run us through a day in the life of you what time do you wake up in the morning what's your first meal like tell us what play by play what you do and i'm going to emulate it as best i can i'm just curious you've given us some good stuff but all right well what time do you wake up not every day is perfect put it that way uh so i would wake up between 6 30 and 7 30. um i do emails for about half an hour while in bed uh texts um i get up i will uh obviously i'll i'll shower and all that stuff but then i'll i'll start my meetings usually around eight uh these are zoom meetings i don't have breakfast i will have a cup of tea or a coffee um i typically also have time to go up and get uh a spoonful of yogurt with dissolved resveratrol in it i just mix it up that or olive oil i'm trying olive oil these days um so i've had a tiny bit of food not not a lot and i'll i'll just go through now it's pretty busy as as you know when i joined you today i'm going from meeting to meeting i'm all already late for my next meeting um so that i pack it in i know i'm sorry um and so how much detail do you want so what i'll i'll be on a meeting for so much i want i want a lot of detail well my i want like as much as you can remember goodness well it doesn't all contribute to longevity i don't think but there's a fair amount of stress there's i don't care checking in on how the companies are doing new results in the lab hiring new ceos um dealing with oh don't do that i can't hear you when you touch that oh uh so yeah so where so a typical day would be uh dealing with issues in the lab companies hiring people firing people uh new results designing clinical trials hearing clinical trial results giving a number of uh you put wait you put olive hold on a second so in the morning you have a scoop of yogurt with either olive oil in it or i can never pronounce it i can never pronounce that word say it please resveratrol reserve yes you put a scoop you put a teaspoon of either one of it right well i'll i'll start with either yogurt or olive oil and mix resveratrol powder a gram of that in there mix that around and swallow it and i've been doing that for over 10 years now and there was a human trial just now that showed that resveratrol was quite effective in preventing metabolic disorders uh so there's that uh i will skip breakfast i'll skip lunch there's just a lot of meetings uh and then [Music] i'll try to go to the gym or i have weights just behind my chair here that i'll i'll lift i try to do 100 push-ups um every day and sit-ups and then uh at dinner i'll either go out for dinner and have a a light meal it could be a salad with some fish maybe or at home same thing but what i'll typically do is have a dinner that's half the size of what you would expect for for somebody my size um and then you know i i do have a glass of red wine occasionally too so that that that contributes to the calories but you're you're not eating breakfast except that that teaspoon of yogurt with olive oil you're not having lunch so you're really only having a meal but you take that meal and you cut it basically in half a portion and then you'll have a so you're not having very many calories a day how many calories are you eating a day i don't know um probably five hundred two to a no a thousand i would i would but i've been losing weight um i mean you're really asking me personal stuff but i've i've been shedding pounds i'm down to the weight that i was when i was in my late teens now um there's barely any fat on my body so i'll probably have to start eating a bit more to maintain that because i've gotten about to the right weight at this point um but yeah it's been uh wow and that was on purpose right you did that oh yeah oh definitely i i wanted to see my abs again so that i could i can say hi to my abs finally after a number of decades i like that and then on the weekends do you do the same as it the same seven days a week or do you take a break and let yourself go on the weekend or uh yeah i might might eat brunch with friends on a sunday uh go out to dinner for sure and eat a a relatively healthy meal at a restaurant i gave up desserts at 40. i don't regret that um but i steal desserts so right that doesn't matter that's still true um i did eat a slice of cheesecake the other day so that's occasionally i give in i mean a cheesecake once in a while doesn't hurt anybody um and i was actually telling a new friend that i ate a piece of cheesecake and she said oh thank god you're normal because she was worried that uh i was so strict about it but that's the thing you don't have to be that strict i don't think um for this all to work and in fact if you're too strict you can't keep it up no exactly and how and how long is each workout you work out every day or you work out like four times a week or what did you said you work out every day in the middle of the day probably how long ev every other day i do some form of exercise whether it's uh weights or cardio or both um mostly i'm doing weight lifting in the gym or here in my bedroom i try to give my big muscles a workout so my legs and back hip hinge exercises are good for people who sit down all day like myself otherwise you end up with this problem that i mentioned i run on a treadmill for only 10 or 15 minutes i really don't like feeling hypoxia it's very uncomfortable for me i don't enjoy running but i do it a couple of times a week maybe three times a week because it's good for me i go for walks i try to walk a couple of times a week for at least an hour outside and then in summer i do a lot of kayaking and water sports so i'm looking forward to that too resveratrol [Music] you
