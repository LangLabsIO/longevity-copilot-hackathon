[Music] foreign not really to any significant degree except there is a change in women post-menopause you know uric acid is contributed to by what are called purines they're the breakdown products of DNA and RNA and it turns out that two-thirds of those purines actually don't come from our Foods they come from our own breakdown of our own tissues when we go about our daily lives and certainly when we exercise and especially if we exercise aggressively and do things like lifting weights we're breaking down muscle tissue in that instance and that liberates some of those purines can raise uric acid as we age we have less muscle mass for example and that might explain why there's not a real dramatic increase in uric acid as we age except in women post-menopause and the reason for that is that estrogen which is certainly higher pre-menopause helps the body rid itself of uric acid so premenopausal women have a a pretty uh good control over their Uric acids but you know these days with all the the fructose consumption in beverages in the fruit juice Etc we see a lot of elevation of uric acid and interestingly when there's a a clinical situation in which women have more testosterone than they should and less estrogen we call this PCOS a polycystic ovarian syndrome they get high uric acid so uh you know here is a really good metric that we can follow ultimately to inform us as to how effective we are at re-establishing hormone balance in women with this very pervasive disorder PCOS the number one cause of infertility here in America so women generally have an advantage earlier on but then you know the tables get leveled later in life foreign [Music]
