[Music] well there's no way around it um any moderate to high level of uv exposure will age you that's the easiest thing you can see twins that one has not exposed their skin to light or has smoked you can see the massive difference even in identical twins so there's really it's not a debate it's just a fact that if you burn your skin or even expose it to moderate levels uh you will age and probably you're accelerating your epigenetic age of your skin through dna damage which we've shown does accelerate the clock so it's pretty simple you can you can get a spray tan if you want that's that's safer or what i do is i i just have low levels of uv exposure i mean you can tell that i don't spend a lot of time in the sun and that's that's voluntary i do spend some time in the summer out you know i do like to do a bit of water sports but i'm always covered in um in sunscreen in safe sunscreens and i'm even developing a new sunscreen uh with one of my companies that is in collaboration with nasa but that's maybe a different story for another podcast time that um bottom line is don't get burnt because your body will get overwhelmed your certains will get distracted move around and you will age um and that's very hard to reverse we don't have the technology yet to reverse that though we are working on it i mean the bottom line is that there are a bunch of chemicals that are being eliminated out of sunscreens as we speak by um probably by this brightening administration in europe they're already banned um in large part because they destroy marine life actually uh and australia has recently banned them uh as i recall and so we're looking for replacements now one of the safest is titanium dioxide so you can have those products there's there are makeups um usually worn by women that contain those um our product actually is is derived from uh an organism that's resistant to radiation and we put that into the product and it works really well we're hoping to have that come out uh this year but yeah what you want to do is just do some research and look for the chemicals that are banned in europe and avoid those over here too in the us [Music] you
