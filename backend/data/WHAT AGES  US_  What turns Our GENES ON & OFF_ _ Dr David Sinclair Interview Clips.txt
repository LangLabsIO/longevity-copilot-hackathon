[Music] in the last few decades where we're starting to see people like me getting diagnosed with cancer in the 30s not 60s because cancer used to be an old person's disease like heart disease we're starting to see it in the 30s we're starting to see multiple sclerosis diagnosis in the 30s you know my 28 year old just got diagnosed with multiple sclerosis so we're starting to see this acceleration of aging what ages us what is it that turns these dna cells on and off yeah well it's actually very simple um we have protective genes in our body we call them longevity genes and the ones that i work on uh have a special name they're called sirtuins but there's this this group of genes that we can turn on by living the right lifestyle but unfortunately today's increasing uh sedentary lifestyle obesity lack of exercise and even the things that we're exposed to such as dna damaging agents these accelerate the aging process and our bodies become complacent you know we we like to feel safe and and not exert ourselves and not be hungry and we live a life now where we don't have to run ever we don't have to go hungry usually ever um and these are the worst things because they turn off our body's defenses against deterioration and it makes perfect sense because we evolved our bodies are meant to be under adversity that's how the life was so counterintuitive though right david you would think that we would want the bodies to be resting more and not be pushed it's good that our temperature we can control it now and have it at 72.5 if that's the temperature we desire and that we can eat food anytime we want because we have an entry and a heard stop you'd think that those would be the things that would make us live longer you're telling us uh-uh it's the exact opposite you gotta stress your body why why do we need to stress our bodies to make them live longer well so the term that we use is called hormesis and that that means anything that doesn't kill you actually makes you stronger and longer live and the reason that that our bodies are set up that way is that we can't always be fighting disease um because that's a trade-off we the body likes to use energy for other things uh like dividing cells making your skin grow really fast and reproducing so it's a trade-off what are you going to do with the food you have you can either grow fast and multiply or build a stronger body and if there's a lot of food around and we're not exercising the body says hey i don't need to defend the body i just need to do this other stuff and it'll it it will divert all your energy into non-survival mechanisms but if you if you run for 10 minutes a day or are hungry during the day you'll actually get your body to put more effort into defending against diseases and protecting you against all those hallmarks of aging that i was describing and so really a little bit of adversity in your body goes a long way [Music] [Applause] [Music] you
