[Music] look at pathway of longevity we can think of the four scenarios one is life extension extension the stralberg's case is from Gulliver travel he came to one of those places where they had those stroudbergs that were Immortal but they continued aging and and it's a terrible story about them and I don't think that's we want we don't want to have immortality with continued aging so this is just the for the framework what we're going to discuss is first of all compression morbidity the ability to live healthier for longer and be sick very a short time at the end of their life the Dorian Gray case remember Dorian Gray stopped aging but when he looked in the mirror he saw his right age by the way try it I'm doing that I'm looking at the mirror and I'm saying well I I myself am not aging I'm just seeing that in the mirror a really big task is the reversing aging or the Wolverine case or the or the Fountain of views of taking all people and making them young you know that's very difficult but we can do some of it and then Victoria will talk about a Forever Young really about the Peter Pan case you know isn't it going to be easier just to take somebody at 20 and give them some therapy every month or every year and stop the Aging all together and now I want to go to the Forever Young Thing and Vittorio I I realize I haven't introduced you but you're in Stanford thanks for waking up for us you've done incredible job on on stem cells so tell us you know I I think I think what really was important for us was to know that you can take a sperm of a 70 year old man and a egg of a 50 year old woman and we can measure you know Vadim can measure their age probably but when the blastocyst is formed we erase the age of the parents so we have this built-in system where we can erase the age so how do we how do we erase the age later on Victoria yeah and hi everybody well that's that's a great question and you know frankly uh this has been uh you know the inspiration of the of our work over the course of the last uh 10 to 15 years I have to I have to say which is exactly what you just said like realizing that there is there is already um for for from for an evolutionary kind of goal there is already a machine that exists uh in nature uh that uh is responsible you know for erasing uh so the machine was built for other for other purposes right to as you said to change the identity of two fully differentiated cell types the sperm and yak and make a new organism out of those but embedded in that in that molecular mechanism there is already a lot to learn about uh how epigenetic marks for example of Aging can be erased the reset and wiped out uh and these in my opinion this has been the inspiration uh for for two Fields uh which have will have a lot to say and to do uh in the future you know for geoscience uh and in the longevity field the first of course is the discovery of ipsc's uh because you know the the work on nuclear transfer was the inspiration somehow for the work that you know LED them to to discover Yoshino yamanaka of ipsis which is the kind of the simplification of what nature does with reproduction in in a test tube uh by reprogramming the somatic cells to ipscs and you can think about ipscs and you know we have endless examples about that that you you can really use ipscs to generate in a in a in a cellotalogous fashion in an individual fashion uh unlimited you know numbers of stem cells tissues organs uh of course you know the field is developing but you know there's endless of examples of you know how IPS technology can be utilized to generate new organs new tissues which are youthful and they can replace a dysfunctional aged organ you know in in any patient spiritually and the second I think the second field that I think uh is now taking off is the idea that if you control that reprogramming process without going all the way back to an undifferentiated state which is you know the IPS States if you can control the reprogramming process very tightly very very finely and precisely you can actually without going all the way back to ipscs you can rejuvenate bring the clock back virtually in any tissue uh any uh any cell type in the in the body and I in maybe not in the so near future but you know very soon I think that we will be able to to really start thinking about therapies that are going to be able to reverse the clock whatever that clock is reverse the clock of of of of any any cell type so and again you can think about this going back to the Peter Pan the Peter Pan kind of you know analogy you can think about applying this to to Asia individuals so you can reverse that process or you can prevent the process from happening and so exciting things to to happen in the future thank you [Music] back [Music]
