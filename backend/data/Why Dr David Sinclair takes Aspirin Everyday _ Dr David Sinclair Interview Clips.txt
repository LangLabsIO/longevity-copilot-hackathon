so [Music] oh yeah i was going to ask you about aspirin is it beneficial to take in terms of longevity you mentioned that also in your in your book lifespan by the way a very good book i recommend it to everybody tons of information thanks uh yeah i take a baby aspirin every day there's an overwhelming majority of of positive data that aspirin is helpful not just for cardiac issues in the future but also prevention of certain cancers such as colon cancer and you know the the media tends to give equal weighting to the positives and negatives of science but when you actually read the literature you find that it can be 99 versus one uh positive versus negative uh and that's the case for aspirin in my view so i continue to take that every day i think in general it's good to try and dampen inflammation in the body um and so until i i see a study that i believe that it's dangerous to take i'm going to continue taking it [Music] [Applause] you
