[Music] so I stand here today after starting a research lab in Boston University at Harvard University in Boston about 30 years ago I'm now 85 years old not true but I am turning 54 soon and like most of us if we just look at today's medicine someone my age has much fewer days ahead than behind them and these days ahead do not look very bright for someone in their 50s and certainly for someone in their 60s 70s and 80s today we live in a world where reaching the age of 80 or 90 and certainly a hundred is is an example of disability and suffering and disease I'm here to tell you that I have no doubt based on what I have seen in my lab and in companies now emerging around the planet that soon certainly within the next decade that we will start to see changes in what we can achieve in our life times so that a 70 year old will no longer have to worry about heart disease and cancer and dementia an 80 year old can look forward to beginning a new life and instead of worrying about the Legacy can think about raising the great grandkids and contributing to society and then even somebody in their 90s can look forward to many decades ahead that future is a certainty and the longer I live and the more research that I see and the results that are coming out from not just my group of 20 scientists at Harvard but around the world tells us that this change in medicine is coming it's really no longer an if it's really a question of when now supplementation I'm asked this question every day David what do you take what should I take just give me the pill that's all I want I don't want it fast I don't want to run I want to just take a pill so I'm not saying that these pills will replace exercise and fasting but I can tell you that I believe they work in addition to these health benefits or these lifestyles NAD boosters I talked about nmn there are other ones such as NR there's one that's being studied here in the UAE called Nar my brother is working on this compound in collaboration with the UAE I take a gram 1000 milligrams of nmn every day in the morning berberine and Metformin are two molecules that either separately or together work to lower blood sugar levels which as I mentioned is very important for longevity and so I take a thousand milligrams of metformin most days of the week this is a drug that you get from doctors for type 2 diabetes but it's also increasingly thought to protect against other diseases so Resveratrol and phys Eden are chemical compounds from plants that are stressed Resveratrol you find in grapes physitan is found in other plants that are stressed and so I take usually between half a gram and one gram of these chemicals as well in the morning spermidine is a very interesting molecule you can find it in every type of cell including plants and you can buy it as a supplement and it's been shown to extend the lifespan of many different animals and probably it works by stabilizing the epigenome vitamin D3 and K2 these are very important of course in places where we avoid the Sun or we cannot get enough sunlight K2 is not very well known vitamin K2 will protect your cardiovascular system from calcium deposits and put the calcium into your bones rather than your arteries and usually those supplements come together in the same pill so I take that I make sure my B vitamins are maintained at the right level I measure them you don't want too high or too low and alpha lipoic acid I did my PhD on this molecule coincidentally and it is a molecule that is very good for the energy in cells and finally the fish oils those are very important for inflammation it turns out one of these molecules activates certain one and maybe that's why these are good for help so this is the basics of what I do and my father does every day including try to exercise and don't eat too much so how old am I well you can measure it I've been taking tests for my age for over a decade and every year over the past decade I've been getting younger according to this test and actually it might be right if you look at my old photos I think I look older than I do now you can be the judge but you can see in this graph here where I sit is here the youngest of about 10 000 people that have been measured my age so I'm telling you science works if you measure change measure change you can go back like I did biologically by at least a decade so I mentioned my father my father is now 83. this was one of one year in his life before covert uh the pandemic at 80 he was as active as he was when he was 30 and feels just as fit and healthy he still has no diseases he doesn't even wear glasses to drive a car at night and so my hope is that my father can serve as a shining example of what Humanity can achieve which is that in your 80s you can begin a new career you can be productive you can learn a new instrument a new language and look forward to another 30 years of life take her message today aging truly is reversible this disease that we all have we can slow it down and we can even reverse it and in the future when this happens we will wonder why we didn't do it before why did we ignore aging until now so I think hopefully I've inspired you to work on your health and stay alive until the radical new technologies arrive which is very soon good [Music]
