[Music] you know it's a topic that is that really will bring me to the whole idea of nutrition science right now there is a general consensus that nutrition science in the is broken and has generated a lot of information that we frankly do not know how to use so i i you know what's clear is processed foods are not good you know natural foods you know based on healthy vegetables is much more healthy epidemiological evidence is clear that consuming vegetables of varied colors is is healthy for you and i think you know when you look at what these vegetables are are comprised of i mean there's lots of nutrients that that we know at least in in vitro systems really have profound effect on on the age on aging pathways on the other hand i i see quite frequently you know people who are abstaining from meat and eating vegetarian diets that are laden with sugar and so what is it about nutrition that you think is important and i i'm convinced that it's not so much what you eat but how you eat you know and and how often and i think you know there's been a lot of discussions about whether it is healthier to be a vegan or a vegetarian or pescetarian or anything so the few principles that i have is that i think meat is okay but in moderation for me i i try to use meat as a as a condiment almost something that just brings incredible amount of taste and i would be remiss and it would be hard for me to imagine that i will never be able to have a sweet italian sausage or something you know a really nice piece of steak barbecued but in moderations in small amounts and and and in my case you know certainly not more than once a week so that's number one so i i'm sort of i'm not convinced about the evidence showing that a vegetarian diet is actually healthier than a diet that includes some small amount of meat number two is i think there's growing evidence that the amount of carbohydrate in your diet is really one of the major determinants and so this the reason why i'm convinced of this is first the epidemiology is strong it turns out that you know there's an inverse correlation between the amount of carbohydrate in your diet and your longevity and and the reason it's it's so compelling is that this is one of the major one of the major pathways that's been identified in terms of aging in many animal models is the incident signaling pathway which is directly driven by carbohydrates we also know that you know carbohydrate drive inflammation so there's there's a lot of compelling uh sort of molecular mechanism of how this actually could happen and then finally you know so not too much meat not no need to exclude it number two decrease your carbohydrate and number three incorporate in every one of your day some degree of fasting and in in this regard i'm particularly fond of the work of sachin panda on on time restricted feeding or the work of alter longo you know the fasting mimicking diet so yeah the idea of incorporating your fasting into your daily routine or on a pizza episodic time time course i think is is really important because what we know is that the shift between fasting and feeding is really one that promotes maximal metabolic flexibility and also you know if you're thinking about in very simple terms i think when i when i fast which is what i try to do every day for about 16 hours so i go you know by what people call this time restricted cheating where you're eating only for eight hours a day and then feeding uh for 16 for fasting for 16 that this the 16 hour period is actually one in which i experienced the the strongest lucidity in terms of intellectual function but also i exercise while fasting and i think it's a it's a time for your body in some way for all of the digestive process for your intestine for all of this to to rest and to shift to burning fat and or ketone bodies so i think these are the three for me the three elements of what i think we can do today obviously there's more coming on there's supplements that are addressing you know the whole nutrient space and you know talking about nad metabolism and so on but i you know many of those frankly are not proven and i think are still under investigation so i think that that's how i think about nutrition today [Music]
