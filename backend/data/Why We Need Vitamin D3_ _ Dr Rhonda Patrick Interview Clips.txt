[Music] I think when it comes to to some of the easiest things that people can do it usually comes down to unfortunately taking a pill so I know you might be going what is she talking about well um you know I the the micronutrient inadequacies is is a it's a widespread spread problem in the United States and and other developed countries as well where you know there's about 30 to 40 essential vitamins minerals fatty acids amino acids that we have to get from our diet and if we don't get them from our diet we are going to be inadequate in them and these essential micro nutrients are doing very important things in our body from running our metabolism to making sure our enzymes which are proteins inside of our cells that are basically doing all the work responsible for everything from pumping our blood to our immune function to neurotransmitter function so basically everything they require these you know micronutrients as cofactors and um it's it's definitely I think safe to say that diet food first approach and getting getting all your micronutrients from Whole Foods eating diverse Foods is Paramount however many people it's it for whatever reason they will not do that um they're you know busy or they have a habit or there's you know other sorts of uh dysregulation perhaps in in satiety mechanisms and you know so getting getting some micronutrients like some of the important ones from a supplement and these are these are easy ones vitamin D vitamin D is an easy one um you know that's something that we usually make in our skin from the Sun and about 70 of the US population has inadequate vitamin D and that's kind of defined as less than 30 nanograms per milliliter if you're in the United States if you're in Europe that would you'd have to multiply that by 2.5 but um 70 of the US population has levels below that and there have been many different meta-analyzes you know over the decades you know dating back all the way to the 1960s looking at vitamin D levels and all-cause mortality and it's it's you know pretty clear that having levels above 30 is associated with a lower all-cause mortality all cause mortality other words people are less likely to die from non-accidental causes of death whether that's cardiovascular disease although I would say cardiovascular disease is probably the weakest with respect to vitamin D cancer mortality is down respiratory diseases down those are two of the really big ones the big drivers with respect to lowering all cause mortality but um so taking a vitamin D supplement is one of the easiest things to do why is widespread deficiency you know so common well because we're inside in our cubicles and our offices at our you know techno with our technological advances computers everything we don't spend as much time outside you know doing agriculture doing you know the sort of Outdoors kind of um jobs that you know that were common 100 years ago so so people are not making vitamin D from their skin and on top of that there are very there are a variety of factors that actually actually regulate whether or not we can make enough vitamin D in our skin and that you know from everything from age so a 70 year old person makes 20 like literally 25 of what they made as their 20 year old self so it's very inefficient as you get older skin color so melanin that pigment that basically acts as a natural sunscreen also is a you know filter for UVB radiation which is actually what needs to basically penetrate through the skin to start vitamin D3 synthesis in the skin so because melanin is a you know is a natural sunscreen sunscreen also does that people wear a lot of sunscreen nowadays so there's there's many different reasons why people are not getting as much vitamin D in our modern day world and and vitamin D is one of the the cheapest and easiest supplements to take there have been studies that have basically try to to figure out like how can you take a person who is deficient so deficiency would be 20 nanograms per ml or less and when you start to get less than 20 nanograms per milliliter you start to go you start to run the risk of you know bone problems and severe other types of severe problems immune dysfunction for example people that are deficient and supplement with about 4 000 IUS per day can bring their self up to a sufficient level closer you know above 30 nanograms per ml perhaps even closer to 40. and 4 000 IUS per day is actually the tolerable upper intake set by The Institute of medicine for vitamin D3 and I just want to mention you know vitamin D is unique among the vitamins because it's actually it gets converted into a steroid hormone so vitamin D3 goes to the to the liver it's converted to a another metabolite called 25 hydroxy vitamin D that's the major circulating metabolite of vitamin D that's usually measured if you get a blood test and then it goes to the kidneys where it's then converted into the steroid hormone that's 125 hydroxy vitamin D and what I mean by a steroid hormone most people think about estrogen testosterone those are steroid hormones like imagine if 70 of the you know of men in the United States were deficient in testosterone like they would be terrible so you know vitamin D's is is basically very different because it basically can enter What's called the cell nuclear the nucleus of a cell and that is where all your DNA is and it can basically recognize this little sequence of DNA and it um it's it's basically you know binds to a receptor and you know you know it binds to your DNA and turns genes on activates them and turns other genes off and deactivates them in this like coordinated fashion and these are genes that are important from everything from brain functions so serotonin is one it's important for the synthesis of serotonin in the brain to immune function and it's it's why vitamin D plays such a critical role in helping prevent respiratory diseases [Music] oh [Music] [Applause]
