[Laughter] [Music] [Applause] [Applause] ford let's move back a little bit if we can back to uh sirtuins if we can and the the function of sirtuins and how important they are the seven sirtuins that have been characterized for within that influence of mitochondria for uh uh influence the nucleus but let's look at uh if we can the the notion that we actually do have some control over the activity of the sirtuin pathways and maybe we can talk about that in terms of how our lifestyle choices might affect circulants right uh so this this is now going back to the yeast days uh what we showed when i first joined harvard was that if you make a hungry yeast cell it will make more of a molecule called nad uh the long form of nad if you spell it out is nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide and it's a small chemical that cells use for two reasons one is it's used for 450 or so chemical reactions without it we're dead probably in 20 30 seconds but the other thing that that cells use it for yeast and humans is to gauge cellular stress adversity and we found that when cells were hungry or they had too much salt or a few too few amino acids they made more of this nad and the sirtuins they don't work unless they have nad they have their own enzymatic reaction that absolutely requires nad to work it's called d acetylation and that's how they control chromatin and the epigenome and so as as levels in the e cells rose in response to being hungry the sirtuins in the cell came on more active preserved the epigenome improved dna repair and the cells lived longer by about 30 percent and we had papers in the early 2000s showing that something very similar happens in mammals as well uh in rats at least and and now in humans we know that when you're hungry your exercise uh levels of nad go up and we hypothesize that they also protect the body um a great example of that in mice is uh was an experiment done by my good friend and colleague shin imai from washington university in saint louis his team made a mouse where he turned on the sertuan gene number one sur t1 in a mouse's neurons and that mouse lived longer which is great news and so what i think is going on is when our body perceives adversity a million years ago our ancestors were often hungry and had to walk or run a lot this turns on the survival program that keeps the epigenome in a younger state repairs dna and does other healthy things as well well nad was a really boring molecule in the day i mean when we learned about nad back in the day it was involved in energy that was a maybe we spent a day on it but now as is so often the case we're seeing that uh molecules have a lot of different roles in the body despite uh you know their original characterization or even how they're named so what you're saying then is that the activity of sirtuins is nad dependent and we really depend on having good certuin activities to do the various things that you've now described and i think you you mentioned that we can increase nad levels which decline with age and are seen to be declining in people who have chronic degenerative conditions interestingly that we'll get to this perhaps that seem to predispose them to bad outcome with covid but nonetheless because of this decline in nad it might be in our urges to do whatever we can to bump our nad levels so how do we go about that what can our viewers think about to do to increase their nad levels uh well so what i do is i try to skip one or two meals a day um and i wouldn't say this for very young people certainly not teenagers but i'm 51 now i don't need three four meals a day and snacks and dessert so i'm eating maybe one and a half uh meals um focusing on plants i try not to eat too much meat though i do eat meat i don't eat too much sugar um sugar spikes will suppress your pseudoinactivity we think the other thing you can do is is simulate uh exercise well lift weights uh is what i do i do a little bit of running try to lose my breath just 10 15 minutes twice a week is enough actually we think to to turn on these defenses you can do something artificial which is what i do um i take a precursor to nad which forces the body we know from human studies to make more of this nad molecule the one that i take is called nmn there's another one called nr which are available as supplements and in clinical trials we've seen that that can raise nad levels uh about twofold um if you're a marathon runner by the way you probably only have nad levels about 50 higher so you know you could argue that i'm higher than a marathon runner i certainly couldn't even run a marathon but i do think um you know based on an n of one as we say i can run further than you would otherwise think based on my level of training so that that's one thing i still take my good old molecule resveratrol uh anyone who's followed my career knows resveratrol came out in the early 2000s from my lab as an activator of cert one uh we then showed that you could give resveratrol to old and fat mice and it helped them they lived longer they were healthier um and we've gone all the way it was controversial because the molecule is is what we would say a dirty molecule that was doing other things as well but we're just writing up a manuscript now david where we've first of all we had a science paper in 2013 that showed that resveratrol does activate the enzyme directly this was controversial but we showed it does and you could mutate or change one amino acid in that enzyme and it blocked resveratrol's activity we've now made a mouse that lacks that one amino acid in the cert one enzyme and given a resveratrol and a high fat diet and lo and behold that mouse didn't respond to resveratrol it couldn't run further it wasn't healthy so that that's my you know full stop period in that debate resveratrol does work in at least in large part through resveratrol for lifespan so i continue to take resveratrol every day and those are my two main things among the other things that i list in my book on page 304 well done uh and i as i said to you and ourselves that uh that i've i went through two highlighter pens and i'm not kidding you it was uh there's a lot to learn um you you uh correlate or kind of discuss uh resveratrol as is getting this activity uh to happen and then the nad is sort of hitting the accelerator yeah that's the the double combo yeah it i think of the nad is the gas and the resveratrol is the accelerator and together they work well and part of the problem is that we lose we think we lose nad as we get older if you take a skin sample you have about 50 less at age 50 as you did when you were 20 on average um and we also think there's an endogenous a natural activator that we make as we you know in in our bodies we haven't found what it is the closest that that is the candidate is actually oleic acid um doug martinez published a paper last year remarkable that oleic acid works exactly the same way as resveratrol and when you change this amino acid it's not only blocking resveratrol and and the drugs that were in clinical trials but also a lake acids activity um so i've actually started taking oleic acid as well um i like acid you might say well that's that's in olive oil that who what's that got to do with anything well first of all it might help explain why olive oil and avocados are good for you but it also turns out oleic acid is made in our bodies when we're hungry from the breakdown of white fat um and so if that story is true it certainly would bring all of this uh knowledge together into one theory so we can take a precursor for nad nicotinamide mononucleotide nicotinamide riboside you take nicotinamide mononucleotide we can exercise that bumps up our nad levels and we can expose ourselves to heat and cold there was a picture of you standing out in the cold and uh we interviewed i think you posted this past week mr wim hof who is the ice man who that was a great interview anyone who hasn't listened to it you have to it was great i i immediately jumped in the pool but i live in florida so i wasn't that cold so anyway uh but having said that um we know that the conversion then of nicotinamide mononucleotide into nad plus is there's an enzyme nicotinamide phosphoryl ribosomal transferase that seems to be amped up by either the heat being stressed by heat environment or being stressed low-grade stress we call that hermesis in a positive way of being in the cold so what else can we do to bump nad aside from hope we don't get older well those are the main things metformin might do it there's some overlap between ampk which is one of the targets of metformin among other things um but those are the main things that i do um and then the leic acid makes it you like and i'm going to say a a significant number of people in the longevity world are taking a drug and the reason i ask that is actually we had a show of hands uh i was on the um founding board of x prize longevity and at our very first meeting they asked how many of you are taking metformin a drug and surprisingly i was very surprised by the number of really smart people who are taking form and adding david sinclair to that list and i'm tempted as well but i will uh maybe we can just explain why you're taking this amp kinase activator why you think it's looking at risk benefit ratio you've made a decision to take it right right so unlike yourself i'm just a phd so i i don't make recommendations even for supplements but certainly not drugs but what i have been excited and convinced as a scientist about uh is the data right i'm i'm driven by data i'm also by the way influenced by smart colleagues and friends and near barzillai who's at albert einstein of college culture medicine is a scientist and a proponent of metformin for protecting against age-related diseases so his opinion i hold very highly but also i've looked into the data and there are a couple of scientific papers that looked at over 10 000 people there was there's one that's looked over over 10 over 10 000 veterans who either did not take metformin or did okay it it's a prospective study um not sorry it's a retrospective study so it's got some issues but when you look at that data it's it's really quite compelling because the people who took metformin for their type 2 diabetes right high blood sugar is what you typically are given metformin for those patients the risk of getting not just worse type 2 diabetes but also if they were predisposed to cardiovascular disease or alzheimer's or frailty their risk went down and those people who didn't take metformin who by the way in most cases didn't have diabetes their risk went up over time over a matter of i believe it was uh four or five years after that that to me was really convincing that this drug could protect against those diseases at least if you're high risk we don't know about average risk people but you mentioned risk and reward this is important for me and for my my father who's a scientist as well who has a lot higher risk right now at age 81 you ask yourself what what are the chances of it doing harm and if it's almost zero then you look at the cost of the medicine and if it's cheap uh the downsides are really low and the upsides are potentially high the real risk i mean let's be honest the real risk is aging itself uh it's going to happen there's no denying it and for most of us it's not pretty what happens and so then when you balance those up it's it's almost obvious uh to me that that these risks are worth taking but of course you know people have different tolerance for risk and and don't all have access to scientific papers and can judge them but to be sure as you mentioned earlier i mean it was what i think our segue was that exercise is also a powerful activator of the amp kinase pathway well it is and that that's a a relatively safe way to do it it's not risk-free either right i've had a couple of friends die from um infarctions recently that that over stress their bodies we think to to to do that but yeah if you do moderate exercise and you do it over long periods of time your risk of mortality goes down dramatically there are there's one study where people who cycled a lot and the number david i can't remember exactly but it was quite a lot let's say 40 miles a day something like that their risk um overall mortality risk went down by 40 percent in their later decades which is a remarkable benefit so yeah i mean if you're not interested in pharmaceuticals or supplements exercise and fasting are too i wouldn't say easy but but relatively available things you can do but you want to start before you become frail of course because it's very hard to do this once you've lost your muscle mass well it takes us to another place and that is the notion of uh the sweet spot if you will i hate to say that because it connotes sugar but but that said between becoming frail and building up uh you know i'm getting to the the this sort of dichotomy between the importance of autophagy of breaking down and the importance of building up but not overdoing it you know how do we how do we get to that important place of of determining what's best in other words how much breakdown of our tissues do we want to encourage versus how much buildup you know as as mediated by our stimulation of the mtor pathway do we want to encourage as well so how do we you know how do we look at that what what's your take on that because you know i know that you are exercising you are restricting your caloric intake you're reducing your number of uh feedings i hate to say that that's a laboratory animal per day or how often you eat uh i think you're probably paying good attention to your your sleep uh and so where do you where does one find that balance i mean i know you're you know james clement he wrote a wonderful book called the switch we had him on the program and it's really talking about that pivot point where do we determine that well there's no one size fits all that's why in my book and in my life i i turn to devices like the one i'm wearing on my wrist uh it's an apple watch um but there are plenty of others i also haven't a ring the aura ring o ura i also occasionally take blood tests um and look at what's happening to my body particularly if i change my lifestyle um i want to know what's happening otherwise i'm flying blind and i don't know if i'm doing harm or good to my body um but i measure about 34 things i'm in full disclosure that the company that i use i i'm an advisor to but i want to mention it because i think your listeners will want to know what i do uh it's called inside tracker and it's a boston-based company um and i've got 11 years of data on my body for these markers and i can estimate my biological age rather relative to other people but also i can see when when things are starting to trend up with age or lifestyle and i correct them as best i can and so far i've been able to keep my you know my estimated biological age younger than i otherwise would be now this is different than the whole vat clock which i haven't measured yet uh but i will oh i bet you're dying to do that well i'm a little bit worried that i'm i'm going to get a bad result but uh i wanted to have to tell us though of course i will i'm a scientist i'll tell everybody the the other reason david that that i'm a little bit uh hesitant is a colleague of mine took two tests from two different companies and got an eight year difference in the answer so i'm waiting to see where it falls and which one is proven more accurate um and then i'll do it because i don't want a false reading and then either you know i think it does uh kind of point to the accuracy of the the various available now so-called horvath or at least dna methylation tests that are out there and you know again dr horvath has been noted to to indicate that his methylation measurements and that patterning uh which there now are several he has one called the uh the grim age which kind of predicts when we're gonna die that was named after the grim reaper but that it's been sort of inviolate at least for those of us who are in shape he did indicate that there is an impact of lifestyle changes in people who are overweight or have diabetes there was one recent publication i believe was last year in october uh looking at overweight african americans and the only intervention in those who had low vitamin d levels was to at various levels replete their vitamin d i think was 600 up to 2000 uh iu a day and demonstrated in fact uh changes in i think it was the velocity or the rate of change of the horvath clock or it may have been the delta between chronologic versus age versus the hormone age but you know really uh interesting information there that um you know in moving forward i think that it's going to be really terrific that we can apply that information to ourselves i want to get back to knowing about yourself you are the end of one and i've been speaking to our viewers for quite some time about what i learned in the morning when i wake up and have on my aura ring and we did a nice interview with the founder of that company what i learned about last night's sleep was it restorative did i get enough deep sleep did i have enough time in rem did i have enough total sleep and then tweaking modifications for me as the n of one i wear a continuous glucose monitor we recognize how you've talked about today how important knowing your blood sugar is and how the choices that i make in terms of my diet my periodicity of eating my how i honor my chronobiology in terms of when i eat and how that affects my blood sugar and i am a full disclosure an advisor to a company called levels health that while they don't provide the continuous lucas monitor they then deal with the data and give you good information about changes that you can make and then you know laboratory studies that are that are really generally available i mean i think it's really valuable to know markers of inflammation your hemoglobin a1c and your uric acid level i think in moving forward we're going to hear a lot more about the relationship between elevation of uric acid and many of these downstream effects that we talk about in terms of inflammation metabolic disease but [Music] you
