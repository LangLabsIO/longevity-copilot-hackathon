so [Music] so [Music] as well anyone who is looking to increase their supply of nad in the body by taking nicotinamide riboside or nmn do you think we should keep an eye on methylation and methyl groups because isn't it possible that we could use up too many of the methyl groups as we're getting rid of methyl nicotinamide and then we know that the methyl groups are needed to affect biochemistry with homocysteine with catecholamine degradation in the brain et cetera et cetera right so it's anecdotal right now but to me it makes sense and in an abundance of caution i'm um making sure i have enough methyls in my diet and you can get them in a variety of ways there's betaine which is also known as tmg trimethylglycine right right um you can buy that i've got a bit at home you can buy it as a powder and you can just eat it doesn't taste too bad it's not going to hurt you as far as i'm aware you can also take a combo of methylfolate and methyl b12 which is um you can get on you know on on the internet and i i feel like that is my best solution to this potential problem of losing methyls to the excretion of nicotinamide yeah and i think i take glycine actually specifically trimethylglycine is is actually to counter what i think might be going on with an nad booster now to raise nad levels what we've done in my lab to mice for the last decade is we give them precursors to nad so we give them molecules like nicotinide riboside or nr or nicotinide mononucleotide also known as nmn not to be confused with m ms which will have the opposite effect and uh so nmn is is what i take each day i take a gram of it but the thing with nicotinamide mononucleotide nmn is that it it has this nicotinamide group on it it hangs off the main part of the chemical and it's the first bond to break and so we see in animals and even in humans that the levels of nicotinamide go up quite rapidly after taking nmn or nr and two look two high levels of nicotinamide are not good um in part because the nicotinamide gets excreted through the kidneys and it's done so that happens because it becomes methylated into methyl nicotinamide and methyl nicotine might have been used for for years as a marker of all sorts of things in including at least experimentally for parkinson's disease but the concern that's that's been talked about in social media especially is is this drain of methyl nicotinamide a problem the methyl groups are are needed for the body we need methyl for a whole range of things including antioxidants and so as a precaution i take trimethylglycine so that i continue to give my body a source of methyl groups now i don't know if that's true people ask me all the time i take it as a precaution because i know that trimethylglycine is not going to hurt me glycine is good um and the other thing is methylglycine is also known as betaine uh which on human cells is very good for them including protecting them against stress so i don't see any downside it's not an expensive molecule and the upside is that i'm preventing my body from being drained of methyl groups so i do take it as a precaution knowing that it's probably not doing anything except goodness [Music] [Applause] [Music] you
