[Music] the practice of fasting I've been telling most of the world that it is one of the best ways to slow aging the reason is it's not just that perhaps you lost weight it's because you've turned on your body's defenses against aging your body's fight aging when you fast and when you do these things that I'll tell you about the other thing that we discovered in my lab is that plants make chemicals that turn on the body's defenses against aging just like fasting does they turn on the NAD production and they also turn on the sort 1 protection and they stabilize the epigenome plants when they are stressed make Xeno hermetic molecules and you can find these molecules for example in olive oil and in very colorful vegetables when plants experience trouble adversity they make these survival molecules that when we eat them we sense that there's a danger and our bodies fight against aging and disease so here's one other take-home lesson you want to put your body in adversity mode not too much you don't want to hurt yourself but today's lifestyle is too easy right even our suitcases have wheels on them this is a problem because it tells our body don't bother fighting aging everything's great lots of food we don't need to run it's all good we don't even experience a lot of temperature changes anymore so we need to go back to how we used to live so what I recommend is not to eat three big meals a day because the body gets used to it thinks that it's doesn't need to survive exercise and stretch the reason Exercise Works is because it makes the body fight against aging it turns on these protective cert1 longevity genes and three belts or three days a week or 15 minutes of losing your breath is known to be sufficient to reduce cardiovascular disease by as much as 35 so a little bit goes a long way as I mentioned you want to eat plants that are colorful and exposed to adversity and what's very important which is not typically done in most countries though the uae's the leader is you want to measure things because if you don't measure things you're blind you're blind we cannot drive a car without a dashboard we cannot drive a car with our eyes closed so why do we practice medicine this way it makes no sense and so by measuring myself I've been able to optimize my own body so if there's a few things you can do immediately sugar is a real problem sugar will stick especially glucose sugar will stick to your proteins it will bind to your blood proteins and it's toxic it causes type 2 diabetes but it also causes a lot of other diseases and I think that avoiding a lot of sugar is one of the best things you can do for your children and for yourself Mediterranean diet we know that it's healthy okay so eat a lot more plants than meat avoid red meat if you can doesn't hurt if you eat it occasionally the reason is that if the body has a lot of protein it may grow fast and you will get muscle slightly quicker but it will not fight aging so that's why fasting is good the body will feel the lack of protein and fight aging try not to snack let your body rest from food and if you feel like you need to drink or eat something have a tea have a coffee that's okay always be active move I mean you can see I I'm moving all the time I try to sitting is as bad as smoking for longevity so you could get a standing desk if you need to work walk a little go upstairs if you can and maintain your muscle mass especially for men we lose about a percent of our muscle mass every year over the age of 40. so I try to eat one main meal a day I'm not always successful when I'm traveling for sure my goal is to try to put most of my calories into six or so hours per day and not always be nibbling on food importantly if you try to do everything I do tomorrow you will fail I believe you need to change things slowly so try to eat a small breakfast or skip lunch or try to walk more these small changes will eventually compound and you can get up to 15 years of extra life just by doing these simple things [Music] foreign
