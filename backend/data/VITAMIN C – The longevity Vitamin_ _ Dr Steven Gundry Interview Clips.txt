[Music] we are one of the few animals that do not manufacture our own vitamin c us monkeys and guinea pigs and vit yeah and vitamin c is actually essential to repair cracks in collagen that occur as our blood vessels flex flex and normally we should have a continuous supply of vitamin c one of the theories of why humans get heart disease is we do not manufacture vitamin c but vitamin c is actually a longevity vitamin very interesting studies uh using mice we have there are five genes that take glucose and turn it into vitamin c we have all five of those genes in us but the fifth gene is called a ghost gene it's not active so they've taken mice and bred them to have a ghost gene as that fifth gene and so they can't produce vitamin c which they normally would and if you compare them to normal mice they will only live half as long as the mice that contain all five vitamin c genes here's the fun fact if you put vitamin c in their water and they drink water throughout the day then the mutant mice will regain the same life span as the mice that manufacture vitamin c because they've been drinking vitamin c all day long so vitamin c is a water-soluble vitamin and we excrete most vitamin c and it's pretty much gone from our system in two to four hours so you have two options either you take time to release vitamin c a couple times a day or you get yourself some vitamin c tablets chewable tablets and you chew a 500 milligram one oh four times a day breakfast lunch dinner and before you go to bed and that's actually the evidence is very interesting that that's one of our design flaws now it wasn't a flaw because we used to be exposed to vitamin c containing plants continuously and interestingly enough making vitamin c is expensive and if we're exposed to something it's silly to waste energy on making something you're always getting but yeah vitamin c is really important [Music] you
