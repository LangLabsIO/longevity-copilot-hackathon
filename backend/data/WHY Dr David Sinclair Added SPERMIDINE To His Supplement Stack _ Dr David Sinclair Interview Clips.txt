so [Music] foreign uh so spermidine is a is found throughout life it is found in sperm but it's also found in plants it's found in you know in our bodies and it's called a polyamine it's a really small molecule that is actually very protective against things like oxidative stress and one of the things that it's been found to do mostly is to induce autophagy the ability of the body to recycle all proteins and make proteins back into amino acids to build new proteins which is very important for longevity and frank mageo who certainly you know and i know he's a scientist from austria has done about 15 years of really high quality research looking at starting with yeast cells where there's spermatidine grows so in worms and flies and mice and increasingly some studies in humans that we're aware of that is not yet published but we're going to share that with you this molecule extends the lifespan of all those species and that's really amazing there are very few molecules that i'm aware of that does that um so i've recently started taking spromadine as well because we we want to induce autophagy and that would help induce what fasting would normally do or it would help accentuate the benefits of fasting [Music] [Music] you
