[Music] the title of our paper is potential reversal of epigenetic age using a diet and lifestyle intervention a pilot randomized clinical trial we became interested in epigenetics because we practice functional medicine so we're concerned with genetic expression we did our eight-week diet in lifestyle intervention the diet is you know again designed specifically to influence methylation it's very methyl donor dense there are a lot of greens there are other nutrients that can influence the methylation cycle such as beets choline from eggs we encouraged people to have liver a few times a week which is high again in folate and b12 we also included a lot of the polyphenols that have preclinical data on them for influencing dnmt and tet enzymes uh and in fact a lot of really interesting research again going back to cancer epigenetics and these polyphenols actually influencing the re-expression of of hypermethylated and inhibited tumor suppressor genes so we were interested in that particularly because a lot of those polyphenols actually have very long traditional use histories so for instance curcumin or egcg or resveratrol luteolin lutein allergic acid quercetin you know when you look into traditional medicine we see of course you know millennial long use for for green tea and curcumin by way of example but they're all pleiotropic in their effect anti-inflammatory antioxidant anti-tumorogenic etc and at least some of those mechanisms i suspect are driven by epigenetic changes so diet heavy methyl donors but also you know these methylation augmenting polyphenols we had we included an exercise prescription which was at least five days for 30 minutes at a perceived exertion of 60 to 80 percent so not necessarily intense we tracked sleep and encouraged them to get at least seven hours per night and gave them some basic sleep hygiene uh tips as they requested we did a meditation there was a meditation intervention as well so everything that we did has some evidence in the literature either in clinical studies or pre-clinical of influencing favorably dna methylation we use two supplements a prebiotic a lactobacillus plantarum we did that specifically because there's some evidence that lactobacillus plantarum may increase endogenous microbial production of folate of natural folates and we also included a greens powder so again the polyphenols that i just mentioned those in a concentrated powder and our participants took each of those supplements twice a day outcome we looked at the epic illumina array we looked at a host of blood biomarkers subjective questionnaires our chief finding our most exciting finding was looking using corvette we collected saliva and then using horvath 2013 dna methylation biological clock we showed a significant reversal of biological age in our subjects by 3.23 years as compared to the control group we had a pretty strict criteria for enrollment it actually took us a while we started this study in 2017 so it took us quite a while to enroll because the program was rigorous and the selection process was relatively involved [Music] you
