[Music] foreign [Music] can you give two examples you started with one of gero Therapeutics because we gero scientists wanted develop gero Therapeutics or general protectors that can extend health Spin and lifespan what's going on now in your in your lab or in your world yeah I can I can talk a little bit about that I think first of all there's probably 20 to 50 of these gero protectors maybe more that have been proposed and there's varying degrees of data on them I think one of the exciting things we're doing in the lab is to begin to test them side by side in human clinical studies and so hopefully we can start to tease out which ones work and which people for what reason I think I mentioned Alpha ketoglutarate and that the reason I like that so much is it's a safe natural product that compresses morbidity in mice so it extends lifespan by a little bit but reduces Frailty by a lot and we have some human clinical data that we're getting ready to publish on that although I must say it's not clinically controlled we also have a placebo-controlled study that we're still completing but there's at least indications that things might be interesting in humans as well uh and then we're looking at a lot of different interventions in animal models and um we've been have still not published this but we've been looking at this fibrate called gemfibrasil uh that is used for hypertriglyceridemia and it has some very interesting properties and we think what it's doing is inhibiting amino acid transport in the gut so we think it has an entirely new function that's not been identified before it's thought to be a p par Alpha activator so we're putting a lot of time and effort into trying to understand if it really does affect amino acid import and if that's why it's affecting longevity and health span [Music] [Music] thank you
