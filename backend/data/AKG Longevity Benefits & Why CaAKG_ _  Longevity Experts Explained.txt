[Music] for category rates is a very interesting molecule for longevity there is a lot of research done with it showing that it can extend large Span in multiple different kinds of organisms you see elegans in androsophila which is our fruit flies it extends lifespan but also in mice and it also has been used for decades by athletes to improve their metabolism and allegedly to improve their stamina and endurance so AKG it's a naturally occurring substance in our bodies so it's a fuel for our multiculture it's actually a part of the Krebs cycle serves as a Krebs cycle substrate Krebs cycle is the cycle that creates energy in our mitochondria so very important to stay alive and have this conversation so AKG is something that occurs naturally in our body but unfortunately when we get older levels of alpha category Decline and we have seen if you give it to mice they live longer and actually they also are much healthier so the health effects are even more pronounced than the longevity or live extension effects so for example if you give old mice AKG or Alpha categlutarate it reduces hair grain it reduces balding especially in female mice it improves the skin of the mice it improves endurance cognition and Metabolism in my eyes and also extends lifespans a lot so AKG definitely very interesting it has many different effects so it acts on many different Hallmarks or mechanisms of Aging for example it helps cells to maintain a proper epigenome as we discussed earlier this regulation of the epigenome is one of the reasons why we age remember the queen bees and and Canker jeans switched on during aging that's all due to the epigenome so AKG or Alpha category is a substrate for epigenetic reprogramming enzymes like that enzymes 1011 transplant case enzymes which player role in methylation so so these enzymes need AKG and vitamin C by the way to properly function and to maintain the epigenome that's also one of the reasons why we added vitamin C to our novels formulation because it works synergistically a bit Alpha category regarding epigenetic maintenance and health AKG also has all the effects it improves mitochondrial uh function which is logical because it's a substrate or fuel for the mitochondria it improves Also let's say collagen production so it could also be beneficial for the skin also there are still showing it can help stem cells to maintain themselves better which is very important because older we get our stem cells become dysfunctional or die off so it's a very interesting substance definitely yeah I think the the cell is a highly engineered system to and it uses metabolism to make all the reagents that it needs to function that could be other proteins or replicating DNA and so you need a lot of energy for a cell to work AKG is a central metabolite that's produced during all of this energy production and it's really at the interface between amino acid breakdown and carbohydrate metabolism so it provides metabolic flexibility for the cell it allows it to move reactions in different directions as needed and when when molecules like that break down with age or go down with age then it becomes much more difficult for the cell to adapt to its uh environment so I think it's really makes the cell more stress sensitive I I AKG is also at about 700 different reactions in the cell and so you know if the levels are going down all of those enzymes mean are not functioning as well well we think the main functional agent is the alpha ketoglutarate but you have to deliver it some way if you just take the acid form of AKG we tried that and it caused a little bit of heartburn in an empty stomach I don't think it's toxic it's just annoying if you take it in the morning um so instead we uh conjugated into calcium so it could be delivered better [Music]
