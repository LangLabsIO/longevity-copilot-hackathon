so [Music] they're more studies with nr because nmn is so expensive yeah well historically some companies started making nr early on and made it widely available and cheap to researchers in fact so cheap they were giving it away to researchers so it became used much more often than nmn but increasingly and if if any scientist lab wants some and then let me know i'm happy to subsidize it if they'd like uh but yeah and animen was laid on the scene because it was harder to synthesize because it's a bigger molecule needs that phosphate and phosphate chemistry is quite difficult so with the with the clinical studies you know there's i've seen a couple with nicotine my riboside but i guess the you know the the question is with the nicotinamide ribosome there's been a little um confusion about like you know whether or not nicotinamide ribosomes even really getting converted into nad inside cells and different organs other than the liver this was this was this nad flux paper that was done by rabo winitz rabinowitz or binowitz thank you um yes that that study um he recently published just a few months ago i'm looking at nicotine and my riboside and how orally at a dose half of what typically is used in all the other nicotinamide riboside animal studies so typically they do 400 milligrams per kilogram body weight per day i don't remember how long the duration they were doing it but um in nad flux study he did 200 milligrams per kilogram body weight which is significantly less than what um all these other studies like the one you mentioned with alzheimer's disease uh and other studies that have shown improvements in mitochondrial function um in mitochondrial mutator mice and also muscular dystrophy and all that so we use double that dose yeah so maybe you know the the this uh nad flex study that showed um nicotinamide ribosome given orally didn't form nad in muscle but it did in the liver could have been a dose dependent thing it would make sense because we we've done a lot of this in mice and now in humans and that there's a threshold that you need to cross you need to take a certain amount to get over probably the body's clearance mechanisms and then you get up to a level that plateaus after about nine days and they may have just been under that threshold so the body was just clearing it out but you have to seemingly overwhelm that clear out system so that's why we do at least 400 uh mixed in and that's what nicotine might riverside the question is i mean that's like if you talk about a human equivalent dose for like 180 pound man that's like over two grams a day and it kind of leads me to that my next question which was um the most recent clinical study with nicotinamide riboside where they actually used a much higher dose than the original study that was done with um basis the elysium that had pterostilbene in it this dose was like a thousand milligrams a day and they looked at a variety of endpoints in addition to when they looked like endurance um looked at it was doug seal study yes and and there's no statistical significance in anything it raised nad levels but there was no statistical significance there was trending improvement in the vascular system and um there's but there was no effect on endurance and i'm wondering again well if we go back to the human equivalent dose what was given to the animals that was still less than half i mean so the question becomes is it not even making nad in the muscle tissue at that dose or you know so um which brings me to the nicotinamide mononucleotide you know like now that those studies have been done in animals at a much lower dose than 400 milligrams they have uh yeah so we in my 11 and at the company metro biotech we've been using a whole variety of different molecules and different we're doing what's called pharmacokinetics so there's a lot of literature that i could talk for another hour on one of the big questions people ask me is have you ever put nr and nmn head to head in a study and we need to do a lot more of those um typically they're not done and i'm unaware of it being done in humans at this point but in mice what we see and for all the nr folks out there please don't be angry this is this is just data i don't run the experiments i just deliver the message that at the same dose uh nmn will increase endurance and i forget what that dose was it might have been 200 or 250 200 uh nmn didn't increase endurance oh sorry nr did not increase endurance but any men did um we do find that for some parameters and matt cabellon who i mentioned earlier who he works on dog aging now after doing his cer2 extension lifespan so matt also has published that uh comparing nr and nmn only nmn work in his his disease model which was a mitochondrial disease where those animals really need a boost of nad so one of the issues could be that nmn is is a better molecule in that regard it could be that maybe the mice just work better than humans and we need a bigger dose [Music] [Applause] [Music] you
