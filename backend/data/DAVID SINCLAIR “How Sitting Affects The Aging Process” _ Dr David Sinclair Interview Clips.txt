[Music] himself and one of the things that she said that i put down that i was really interested on which i haven't heard you speak a whole lot about is just the just being sedentary and just sitting all the time like that's one of the things that i'm i'm getting better at is every hour trying to get up and move in some sort of way and you know the thing that i've already explained is like sitting is basically the new cancer um what is what is the issue with sitting so much and how do you see that happening in in the aging process well i have personal experience of that when i wrote my book uh which took many years but i was literally sitting for about 18 months every day and night uh i ended up suffering my health went um i could barely walk because my piriformis muscle atrophied and then seized up it was in a cramp for six months and that's the muscle that that goes through that hole in your pelvis and it took me six months of exercise and therapy to get back to walking again so i've switched over to having a standing desk uh it's right next to me just here i go on a lot of walks so why why is sitting so bad well first of all your heart rate doesn't go up you're basically a minimal basal heart rate which is bad second of all if your major muscles atrophy you're that if you're a man you can have less testosterone but even for women that lack of muscle bulk is super bad not just because your your hormones are diminished but particularly those people who are my age and older if you have weak muscles it's super bad because hey it's very hard to get them back i took me a lot of work and it's harder the older you get but the number one or maybe one of the top five not number one but one of the major causes preventable causes of death is falling over and breaking your leg or your hip and you've got to keep those muscles that are required for standing uh really strong so that if you fall you don't break you just bounce yeah it's it seems like you know one of the things that that that's happening is people are getting too comfortable it seems right we're staying inside you know inside of my house it's at 72 degrees all the time i can sit most of the day and do all that but then also the same time it's like you know if you think about it we don't put our body through enough stress and you know i live in austin we had this i don't know if you heard about the whole apocalypse thing where it's just like crazy so our ancestors would have been outside in that there would have been massive amounts of stress of going down to five degrees and all that [Music] you
