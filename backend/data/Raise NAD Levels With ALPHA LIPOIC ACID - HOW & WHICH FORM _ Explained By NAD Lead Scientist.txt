[Music] alpha lipoic acids and this activates an ampt but via a slightly different pathway so what alpha lipoic acid does is it actually activates an energy sensor in the cell called ampk and what ampk does is it signals if the cells in a bit of energy stress and if it is an energy stress what it does is it goes oh we need to switch on NAD production so it sets off a series of reactions that basically lead to increased levels of any MPT to increase NAD in the cell and ampm alpha lipoic acid actually activates ampk and the really interesting thing about that is it's that this exact pathway is activated by both exercise calorie restriction fasting all things that are shown to promote cellular health and health span and lifespan in some cases and and it's known that a lot of the beneficial effects of these things are by increased NAD production because again if you think about it the reason uh our bodies are increasing NAD is that they've sensed this energy stress from the axis size of the fasting our body's setting off a reaction saying we need to survive this stress how do we do it we increase NAD we tell us give the mitochondria more NAD to keep producing its own energy we have NAD as a signal molecule to increase maintenance and repair and recycling so that we can get the cells through this period of no nutrients and energy stress and so yeah that's that's a natural way of boosting levels of that enzyme but obviously we're using a molecule to actually do that ala is a really interesting one so you know it's something that you do come across frequently in the in the longevity space um as a you know an antioxidant as well um and you've got to be really careful with ala because um in terms of what what form that you use so there's two different isomers you've got an r and an S version um and quite often if you look in products they'll have the S which is like the synthetic and when you look at all the data that does absolutely nothing in the body it doesn't work at all um at best you'll get a 50 50 mix of RNs forms and so again you're kind of paying for half of it that doesn't do anything so I was really Keen with our product that we only use our ala so it's only the form that we know actually works um and ala is you know it's one of these molecules that acts on many different Pathways in the body and another way that we know that it increases NAD is it actually activates a pathway or an enzyme called nqr one um and then qr1 and what that does is it converts nadh to NAD plus so NAD is a Redux molecule um well nadh um and NAD plus are the reduced in the oxidized forms and it flips between those constantly but what you tend to find is that in older cells it favors more towards nadh and that's not good you want it more towards NAD plus so what this enzyme does is it basically flips nadh to NAD plus so you rebalance um the more favorable ratio of NAD plus to nadh so ala acts as kind of a dual purpose [Music] foreign [Music]
