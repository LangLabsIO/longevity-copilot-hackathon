so [Music] things one is that someone recently discovered that oleic acid which is a monounsaturated free fatty acid which is produced when we're hungry by a breakdown of fat um it activates cert one exactly exactly at the molecular level how resveratrol works yeah and so we made a mouse uh in cells that cert one cannot be activated and we know that resveratrol doesn't work in those cells and in that mouse and then a lab recently showed that this oleic acid doesn't work in that those cells as well which is cool it means that resveratrol from stressed plants is mimicking fasting but it's also mimicking olive oil and avocados that also have this oleic acid so i'm increasingly eating olive oil uh walnuts and avocados that have this this compound and actually it's very potent it i think it's about 10 times more potent than resveratrol maybe a hundred actually interesting interesting is is it present in flaxseed flax oil i'm not sure about that uh i'm not sure either um you should check a little bit definitely i'll definitely do i don't take olive oil because it raises blood sugar so if i eat olive oil i can feel the blood the blood sugar spike i became so sensitive to this so i'm careful what i eat um yep you have yet twenty percent are um roofers monounsaturated fatty acids and it's mainly oleic acid so yeah you're getting flex hazelic acid quite a lot that's beautiful that's beautiful definitely a better choice for me yeah well so so i think this is a good explanation for why these foods are found in populations that are healthier and why these foods are healthy because no one no one knew why these these oils are so healthy and now we have a good explanation [Music] [Applause] you
