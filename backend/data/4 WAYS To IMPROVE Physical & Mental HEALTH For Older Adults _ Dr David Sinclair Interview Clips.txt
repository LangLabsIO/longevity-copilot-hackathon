[Music] well the first would be uh to move if you're not moving now it's only going to get harder as you get older and it's a it's a bad cycle to get in not moving and then you become frail encounter so it's my father i'll keep giving as a good example um he started going to the gym and running in his uh early 50s so you know he started pretty early so he was lucky that way but there are enormous gains even for people in their 70s to start moving and it can be as simple as going for walks um standing up stretching um even lifting light weights is something that if it's possible start doing it because it's only going to get harder the older you get if you don't maintain it and start make that a habit um the other is i'm assuming we're talking about people who are in a healthy state um and not frail you know it's very different if you already have a number of diseases then that's important to consult your doctor as to what your body can handle but if you're in a relatively healthy state um it's not just moving it's it's also looking at the type of foods you eat and when you eat so i've been very lucky to have converted to a plant-based diet the rewards of that are just innumerable um and so i would say that if if your parents or grandparents are eating a western diet that's full of inflammatory foods and processed foods and if they're overweight even worse then steer them towards a much healthier diet also if their body can tolerate it three large meals is unnecessary for most people and so what my father does is he skips breakfast and has a very small lunch and then has all these calories most of his calories at night um again that's that's something that you should definitely start earlier in life but i think in your 70s if you're not frail that's something to consider as well but again under uh consultation with your doctor because everybody's different i don't recommend anything um as i mentioned but i i've seen positive results in clinical trials of people in their 70s now we don't know the long-term safety we don't know um if it might stimulate cancer this is one possibility that people bring up but i've seen no evidence for that i think that the risk is very low and the reward is potentially very high so that's the personal choice that i make and my i know friends and family make uh so what would i say about that i would say that um do your reading or you know get your parents to read my book is a good start there are papers that you can print out that are free on the internet you can give those to the doctor and and have them weigh in uh but what i find is with clients and with family um and people around me my circles uh nmn has been proven or at least is seemingly beneficial in terms of mental and physical health um that's being born out in my lab and in clinical studies so i think it's it's it's a good option and it's also one of the few safe molecules chronic safe molecules out there because it's actually natural and the levels what we're trying to do is just replace what's been lost in terms of its synthesis with age [Music] you
