[Music] foreign so if you're training for performance and this is on applying this to people maybe over at age 50. um then you know that's great there's a lot of benefits from that your training is going to be focused you're going to have specificity of training for the event that you're going for you're going to do Progressive overload to add on to your capability in that in that event you should still follow the 80 20 training which means that 80 of your training should be a low intensity lower than you might expect and 20 should be very high intensity and Elite athletes are starting to transfer over to this training regimen and um I don't have time to go into details on it but there's a lot of information online if you are training for events you should be thinking about this it ends up being better for performance and better for your heart in these endurance activities training for longevity is a little bit different you want to meet the physical activity guidelines so moderate exercise or a ways above that but not into the extreme category so this is a paraphrasing of the general guidelines essentially they suggest that you get at least 150 to 300 events minutes of moderate intensity exercise per week of cardio and the more intense it is the less you have to do so maybe down to 75 minutes and you can do some combination thereof and that can be broken up into shorter sessions so that's something that's added has been added more recently so you don't have to do like a 30 minute block you can do five minutes here 10 minutes there whatever throughout your day they also suggest that you do resistance exercise and flexibility exercise and uh all muscle groups two to three times per week and then some neuromotor exercise so working on balance agility gait uh also two to three times a week and they've added this more recently to avoid sitting whenever possible because it's its own health risk factor we'll talk about that later so this is a lot of time this is this the reason why people aren't meeting the guidelines is it's a lot of time to put into their day so one way to address this issue of you know can you get away with less is there an impact at lower levels than the guidelines is to look at the relationship between moderate vigorous figure moderate vigorous physical activity and all-cause mortality and there are a lot of studies that look at this and they all have very similar shaped graphs and so the Health and Human Services Department in the last physical activity guidelines sort of Consolidated those graphs into this shape curve here and what it says is if your risk of mortality here is normalized at one for the least active group as you increase physical activity on this x-axis you have a very steep early slope and then it starts to flatten out and you can see the physical activity guidelines here so I want to draw attention to this side the left side of the graph here where you go from no physical activity to just a little bit that first group and you can decrease your risk of all cause mortality by 20 percent once you get down to the guidelines even on the early ends of the guidelines then you're about 70 percent of the benefit is reached and then the curve really starts to flatten out so down here you're training for something besides longevity you're really training for performance and a lot of the health benefits have already been obtained which is fine but um you can see that the big gains come at this low end you want to have some bouts of high intensity exercise to keep that maximum capacity as high as you can you want to move throughout your day and reduce the amount of sitting and you want to do a variety of activities and add some resistance training and get outdoors and be social and play you know there was a very interesting study that came out of Copenhagen that looked at types of activities that people did and the amount of years it added to life and it was a very surprising um all the activities added all the physical activities added years of life but the least effective one was gym activity and that's a huge category but working out in the gym next was running cycling and swimming and then the category that added the most Years to Life were things like tennis golf badminton so a surprising finding but it brings in sort of the outdoor activities the social activities um and something that you can do for long periods of time it's very interesting so the advantages to travel for to training for longevity that you compress morbidities so you're healthier for longer and disease comes later in your life and possibly add years of life so your longevity as you enjoy movement and life more you increase function and Independence disadvantages you won't win any marathons and life may be less convenient so what I mean by that is in order to get that movement in your life throughout your day to keep moving throughout the day you have to make choices away from those things that we take that we have for convenience so walking instead of driving you know doing some of your own chores not using machines to do those and so um making you're taking the stairs for example so making your life less convenient adds physical activity into your daily life so in summary your body is watching you and to age well you want to move regularly throughout the day do it with others and play whenever possible and remember a convenient life is not necessarily a healthy life [Music]
