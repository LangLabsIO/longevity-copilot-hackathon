[Music] um if you've ever heard of my lab you'll know that we've worked up here for a while looking at the role of the sirtuins which are epigenetic regulators uh and you've probably heard of the the drugs metformin arapamycin basically this has been a lot of work in the aging field for the last 20 years leading to the paradigm that the environment and molecules that stimulate or i should say simulate fasting and exercise can provide health benefits if not an increased health span and longevity you've probably also heard of senalytics which are molecules being developed in animals and being tested in humans no positive results that i'm aware of yet but these are molecules that can either kill or modulate the gene expression of what are often known as zombie cells and essence cells in tissues that drive up inflammation and may also accelerate aging and this is addressing what i'm calling on this slide the a3 stage the very end of the life of a cell i have a student working on this and he's got some in vitro evidence at least that that it does delay cellular senescence we need to now go into these these mice that we've reprogrammed and really look at that so we don't know yet i think that i mean i think the hypothesis is valid it would make sense another question that we'd like to answer is if you reprogram a senescent cell what happens is it bad uh or does it reduce the sas the inflammation um or could you restart safely restart a senescent cell into the cell cycle you know that that's really uh that would be something unexpected but we're going to try that we know the first part that when we age those mice they get inflammation in cells they get inflammatory markers we see a slight induction of p21 etc so in in the mouse yes we've got in the brain gfap comes on the the hallmark of inflammation in the brain uh that is delayable if that's a word by over expressing cert one that was in philip's 2008 cell paper that i referenced we don't yet know unfortunately whether reprogramming will reverse inflammation we focused on the eye i will check that based on gene expression we think that that's going to be true but we do need to do more work [Music] you
