[Music] the big picture is that we all agree that nad is good for us and we want to keep the levels high as we grow old and then the question is what's the better way to do that and again i'm data driven um i have put both molly both nr and nmn which are the two leading contenders in the market into mice uh and i put a lot of animating to people um and others have done nr so that's the background to this but first let me very briefly explain what the nad precursor world is actually about all right so we started here we got nad that's the molecule that we need for life that we need we think for longevity and youth how do you boost that well you you shouldn't just take nad because nad is a big molecule it's made up it's got two phosphates it's got two sugars it's got nias in it it's big and it cells struggle uh and for the most part cannot absorb it so what you what cells need is a precursor so it's a little smaller version so the smallest version of nad that cells uses is vitamin b3 or niacin also known as nicotinamide but that doesn't seem to work as well because you need other bells and whistles added to get to nad over here remember there's the sugars and the phosphate which is phosphorus plus oxygen so taking high levels of vitamin b3 can be helpful for things like cholesterol this does raise nad levels a little bit it's in cosmetics probably for that works for that reason but i think you can do better so the next thing along that you can give to the body is nr nicotinamide riboside which is a sugar added to vitamin b3 but lacking the phosphate and that sold as a supplement and has shown promise in some studies in humans the most notable one is als or lou gehrig's disease and there's then let's go to the next one which is what i work on mostly which is nmn which is nr plus a phosphate so now you've got the three main components which are then combined into a double molecule that's now in ad so if you give niacin or vitamin b3 now the cell has to find and scavenge sugar and phosphate if you give nr at least you've got the the sugar but you like the phosphate and then nmn has everything and so one of the problems that i think as a scientist is that if you just give nr your body has to find phosphate from somewhere where would it get it it's in bones it's in dna you might have issues finding enough phosphate and that might be why in practice in mice and seemingly if you look at clinical trials in humans nr is not boosting levels of nad in the bloodstream as high as nmn does at the equivalent dose but i can tell you for a fact that having looked at dozens of of clinical patients at harvard medical school that nmn certainly will double or triple your nad levels if you just swallow it and so this argument about you should put it under your tongue or you should inject it to get the best effects um i don't think that's necessarily the case i think just swallowing it works fine and i've seen that now the question is do any of these work in a disease or do they extend lifespan well in mice we've got promising results that we are writing up in humans it's still early days to be honest though one of the companies that i started called metrobiotech uh is in five different clinical trials one for a rare disease called physics ataxia there's a military-sponsored study for endurance uh there's a coveted study actually and one for kidney failure um and there's there's another one looking at mental ability and even alzheimer's disease just sponsored by the national institutes of health a big multi-million dollar grant so there's a lot going on and over the next six months i'm going to be privy to the results of those clinical trials and hopefully shortly thereafter share that with everybody [Music] you
