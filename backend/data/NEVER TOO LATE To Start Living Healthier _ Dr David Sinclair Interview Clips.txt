[Music] well if you look at photos of me from i think probably five years ago um i i looked older i think and i've become stricter in my diet over the last five years as i've gotten older and wiser and less worried about my kids and more about my own health the but also it's an act of love for your kids you know to eat better is an act of love for your children because you want to be here for as long as you possibly can you know every age i lost both my parents in 2016 and i i felt so lucky that i had them my dad was 89 when he died i was lucky i had them for so long but i still miss them i would have liked to have even more of them well that's why i do what i do it sure is and and i i make an argument in my book that we have a responsibility to do this for our loved ones who want us around even for an extra two weeks and hopefully another 10 years it's a selfish act to let yourself age rapidly and it's never too late to start studies you can be 70 or 80 and you can still have a benefit by doing the kind of things i've talked about and my father has shows what you can be like in your 80s he's just as vibrant healthy and probably much happier than in these 30s and 40s and that's the world that i want everybody um to experience in them yeah and you start working out even in your 70s with weight your muscles actually really respond to that so i wanted to ask you for my audience what are your three top tips for mastering your mind all right so what i what i do to do what i do which is take on one of the hardest problems ever faced by humanity uh is i wake up every day realizing it's a gift that i have my health and my energy and my friends and my family so i jump out of bed i start playing loud music i'm dancing around i'm super happy even if the day is going to be stressful i the second thing i do is i surround myself by with positive people i get texts from people pretty much every morning saying today i hope it's gonna be you know you're gonna crush it today it's gonna be fantastic and i send them the same motivation so it's a wonderful uh world to be in and then the third thing that i would say keeps me going is uh i remember um the bad times in life and realized that the little things that are bad today really don't matter and if they if i if i'm not going to remember them next week i'm not going to worry about them so much in fact most of the things you go through you'll forget about a year from now and uh so keep the stress down get good sleep surround yourself with great people uh and just be positive that you're around and and try to stick around for longer [Music] [Music] you
