[Music] we've got some a variety of ways of modulating our stress levels and our and that affects our immune system and our sleep there are two main ones on the two parts of the brain is the the the nervous system which the one that's the most important is the sympathetic nervous system which is the bite or flight one uh that's going to be releasing uh a variety of chemicals including uh one called act that will signal to your pituitary or and that'll release um corticosteroids that are like cortisol which are particularly bad for long-term stress and and pro-aging for the organs and so really we don't want to be in this this sympathetic state so breathing and uh meditation um and good sleep is what dampens that down and gets us out of of that that edgy state that a lot of us feel during the day um and really that's the goal for longevity is to be able to be calm and not not be jumpy um and there are lots of ways of doing that and breathing actually breath work is the fastest way to do that uh it turns out that you can actually uh greatly affect the activity of this nervous system um just by the rate that you breathe and also whether you're inhaling or exhaling if you inhale it actually it heightens your awareness you there's a study that shows that people when they see faces tend to see them as scary faces than when they're breathing out slowly so breathing out is actually really really relaxing doing that rhythmically helps calm down that part of your brain just sits at the back here behind uh where you might have the joint of your uh uh your skull to your to your spine the other part of the brain that's important it's called the most cortex and it signals with molecules that can activate tissue such as muscle that put out various chemicals that uh recruit immune cells and uh there was a beautiful study that came out last year that caught my attention but this paper that came out in uh the journal Nature uh showed that in animals Fe we uh both those separate systems the the motor corex which is up here and then the scn uh which is back here your the control catary if you tweet those neurons artificially and make the animals feel scared and stressed out it does affect your immune system or it affects their immune system and lucites come out and uh and then they recruit to the bone marrow and they behave differently I measure cortisol levels as an indicator of our overall state of chronic stress or even overe exercise can lead to high cortisol levels and that's one of the things that we measure um as predictors of future longevity but you can bring that down it's been shown many studies with meditation breathing exercises and uh getting enough [Music] sleep
