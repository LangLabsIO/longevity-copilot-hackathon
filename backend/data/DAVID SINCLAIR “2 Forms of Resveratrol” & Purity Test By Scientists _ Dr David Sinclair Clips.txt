[Music] so [Music] resveratrol is the molecule in red wine which we worked on for many years we still do a little bit of work on that trying to tease out the mind you share about how it's actually working in the body but we have a lot of really good evidence that one of the ways residual works is this accelerated pedal on these enzymes uh what do i do i still take resveratrol i've been doing that since 2004. i'm still healthy and alive so an n of one clinical trials being successful but there have been clinical trials with resveratrol uh some have shown no effect some have shown positive effects on things like uh endurance and blood sugar levels and all trials are done different ways of course sometimes the patients are older sometimes they have obesity um and and sometimes resveratrol is given with food without food um and reservoir tends to work in clinical trials when it's given to people who are older might have a bit of excess body fat uh and also when it's mixed with uh food that that helps it dissolve because resveratrol is like eating brick dust it doesn't dissolve very well and can just pass straight through the body mix it into your yogurt that's what i do yeah so i did that today uh you know just to prove that i'm i'm not making this up uh i have yogurt i like to use greek yogurt because i find it dissolves very well in that but because i'm trying not to eat until late lunch or dinner it's just a couple of spoonfuls to be able to get the resveratrol into my system um resveratrol i think is extremely safe given that probably a million or more people have been taking it for a long time and nothing has shown up yet um so it's this risk reward you know the older you get the the more risks you're willing to take right um in terms of uh you know you know what's gonna happen if you don't do anything so that's the calculation that i make as well um but if you do take a supplement no matter what it is look for the three letters gmp which stands for good manufacturing practices that means that they're at least like you know they don't have mouse feces in in their factory or whatever so that's that's a start but i also i would encourage you to look for products that are very pure at least 98 percent pure because some some of the products and supplements can be 50 this 50 that and just in the case of resveratrol 50 resveratrol what's the other 50 people don't know and in fact there's reports of people having diarrhoea and who knows what else could be happening so those are my tips there are many benefits associated with resveratrol such as antioxidant the anti-inflammatory and the proliferative anti-angiogenic effects if you are considering taking resveratrol make sure you are taking pure trans resveratrol which is the active form to test the purity we will be using high performance liquid chromatography also known as hplc to make it simple hplc is an analytical technique used to separate identify and quantify each component in a mixture of organic compounds with high precision and accuracy here we have two samples from two different companies that i purchased on amazon since it is not our goal to make judgment to any company but to help you discern what the reliable products are in the market i will call them sample a and simple b sample a was dissolved in methanol filtered and placed into hplc instrument to measure its purity in this type of analysis the instrument will generate a chromatogram which is just a fancy name to describe a graph with multiple peaks that can be interpreted as fingerprint of each molecule existing in your sample the same procedure will conduct it for sample v as you can see sample a is a white powder and simple b is a brown powder when dissolved in methanol sample a became a transparent solution whereas sample b turned to a radish-brown solution after being auto-injected in this hplc instrument it normally takes about 20-30 minutes to collect all the data based on the developed hplc method now let's take a look at the result in sample a we can see in the chromatogram y-axis represents the intensity of absorbance in melee absorbance units whereas the x-axis is the units of time typically minutes and is used to determine the retention time of each peak i'm just being over simplistic here the retention time is like an id number of each organic molecule by using the same method under the same conditions the samples show retain the same retention time sample a here showed an intense and sharp peak with retention time at 12.1 minutes indicating a very pure sample with security almost 99 percent the retention time at 12.1 minutes matches with standard pure trans-reservation further confirming the identity as for sample b the chromatogram also showed an intense sharp peak at 12.1 minutes however multiple peaks were observed with considerable intensity making the purity of sample b only 61 like i mentioned before each peak represents individual impurity therefore there are many impurities found in sample b comparing the two analyses we can see a huge difference between these two respiratory products in my case i have access to lab instrument which makes it easy for me to test my supplements purity and chemical content but what about you what can you do to differentiate between a good and bad respiratory product if you don't have access to a chemistry lab here is what you should be doing when buying resveratrol first and for transverse virtual with purity 98 or higher pure trans resveratrol is an off-white powder while the impure one has a brown color second check the company's reputation transparency and whether the product is manufactured in a gmp compliant facility third find out if the company can provide the certificate of analysis also called coa to ensure the quality of your product [Music] you
