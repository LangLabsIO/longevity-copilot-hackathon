[Music] Etc I would like to touch a little bit in relation to the biom Microsoft aging to the interventions I will only give you two two examples why I think that the biological clocks of the biomarkers of Aging are leading towards certain interventions and I will show you a couple of rcts so I will focus um just for the last uh 3 minutes on on supplements I did lots of studies on nicotinamide mononucleotide you might have heard it you can buy it on Amazon um I see lots of uh uh photos here it's very funny if we're talking of supplements everybody makes a photograph so hopefully you don't take NN you only should take NN if you really need it and then it might help but um nitin mononucleotide is a a supplement um and very often uh people take it because Ned levels are going down with the chronological aging process and if it's going down then the mitochon are not working well you have a higher risk of age related diseases if that's causal or not we do not know but there's a huge amount of evidence that first of all something goes down and that's Ned level and you can supplement it with nmn so that's great it's a little bit like um you have a glucose level you're measuring and um you give insulin so it it works quite well and I show you the data we did a randomized control trial uh for arms giving NN to healthy individuals that's what I'm striving for to optimize them at the age of 50 and just L 60 days so we had Placebo 300 600 and 900 and you only uh get here the the clinically I would say meaningful outcome parameters uh and that is the six- minute working test and the blood age clock and the sf36 which is the quality of life uh marker but most importantly and that was the primary outcome in this RCT are Ned levels going up and yes luckily so the NN was good at 300 and 600 and 900 the Inc the the individuals who got it had a higher Ned level and what we also showed but absolutely look this is a a small randomized control trial absolutely not powered but a secondary outcome parameters clinically meaningful parameters a six-minute working test and the sf36 was the best in the 600 mgram and was equal to to the 900 mgram so which also means we need many more of these studies to see how much supplement you should give because 300 was not enough we think um because also if you look at any level change and that's on the left hand side you see there is an Ned level increase but not at much x 600 so we ask our uh the question in a post talk analysis and think about the analogy of you giving uh insulin and you're measuring glucose and then seeing of of course hopefully a good result can we do the same with Ned levels and and nmn and if with the hypothesis that we should increase Ned levels do the individuals the participants with a higher Ned level increase do they also have better clinically meaningful outcomes like measured in the six-minute working test and um the sf36 and yes it's it's the case especially you need at least roughly 50 nanom per liter increase in Ned level and then you have potentially the highest chance of a clinically meaningful outcome parameter so what does it mean we are now going into an arena like in normal medicine we should would do that we are titrating supplements based on an outcome we can measure there are lots of problems with Ned levels and how accurate they are and how reproducible they are but this is the entire thing thinking now in health longevity medicine to make it really evidence-based like we are manipulating the body with certain interventions and we want to know with hopefully serut markers that it that it actually changed and there's a positive outcome parameter and that's the reason why I'm really argumenting do not just either take yourself supplements but measure first know what you need and don't prescribe it so much like if you don't know what what to do to to clients so we now do an accurate uh study where we really titrating nmn levels and N sorry ND levels based on nmn and some other other supplements we do the same for Alpha ketoglutarate um it's it seems that Alpha ketoglutarate is manipulating epigenetics so at least we know epigenetic changes occur after taking alha ketoglutarate so we do the able study where we only select individuals who are epigenetically older using four clocks and using the median compared to the chronological age we're giving for a couple of months one gram of Alpha ketoglutarate and at the primary outcome again we want to see that these clocks are sensitive to change and um that the biological age is lower this is a first trial really applying these epigeic uh clocks as a selective parameter but also as a primary outcome and we also now do that in um studies where people undergo a major major surgery we are super interested in finding the best food on Earth for individuals also looking at the microbiome Etc and especially looking at what kind of food groups of foods are have the most potential for example at senolytic of being a cenotic ccent cells accumulate how do we get rid of them and we do that for many other Hallmarks of Aging just as an example but I think it's exciting that we could manipulate the body just with food which we already heard from the zoie talk [Music] so
