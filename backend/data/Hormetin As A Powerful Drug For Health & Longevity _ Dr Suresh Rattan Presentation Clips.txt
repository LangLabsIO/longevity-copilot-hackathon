[Music] exercise is not a drug against anything it's a drug for health and that's a hormone the word hormone we use to point it out towards there so the idea which was applied in aging research from about 25 years 30 years ago where my lab you know who was one of the pioneers was that repeatedly challenging the body with mild stress of choice in human beings that a word becomes very important stress of choice will stimulate compensatory adaptive mechanisms and in order to stay in time i will just rush through that what are the basis of that why they get stimulated because we have basically these major seven intracellular stress responses if anything induces the cell to respond by one or more of these pathways that has potential to become hermetic when uv light hits you your dna gets challenged or damaged there are hundreds of dna repair enzymes get activated and i'm glad to know the center for healthy aging morton's group is using that as the search for millions of new compounds fantastic but there are six other pathways there are antioxidant when you have oxidative damage antioxidant response comes in when you have nutritional challenge autophagy takes over when you have inflammation so all these processes are so well studied in molecular biology that you can choose what to follow it up all these so-called antioxidants there majority of them are pro-oxidants but the effect is anti-oxidative because the nrf2 gets activated and hundreds of them antioxidative genes take over so there is huge amount of data available on that based on that we call hormones for health fall under three categories physical hormones exercise i already gave you example data from radiation biology data from hypoxia about uh again heat and cold stress then there are mental hormones a lot of the stuff we do by mental exercise cognitive exercise they are hormetic but most of the research is going on on what we call the supplementary or nutritional hormones all the things in the food which are often good for us are actually good because they are horribly poisonous all spices come under that category why are they good because they are bad and we call call them antioxidants no no no they are hormones even fasting calorie restriction to it so in our labs you know who's in the last 25 years we have done huge amounts of work we are all published so i'm not going to show even a single slide on that just to make this idea available to the industry to researchers that look you can discover new hormones at any level now for example at the moment all these major compounds being tested whether that's a faceting as a synolitic or corcomine or quercetin even even metformin mario i would like to make a comment uh metaphorium metformin kills old cells more quickly isn't that your data yeah that's a synolitic then it becomes you know it's not bad so anyway well that's a part of discussion that's the scenario so nutritional hormones is a big area the problem with the hormatic theory so far is because there also we usually pick one stress pathway at a time but in reality it doesn't work like that so in our labs we have done that that if you give heat shock as a hormone so heat shock response is the first one and the primary but then the remaining six also respond at different kinetics and to different even sometimes negative so we try to create hermetic stress profiles of all the pathways like if you fast yes autophagy will be the first one but then what happens to the responses without that we cannot create a health profile measurement device or something so this is one way which we will need to do if you want to get into hormetic research how to study stress profiles of a healthy and more healthy and less healthy and a diseased individual so a few years ago i have written this protocol for any industry that if you want to discover new hormones how that should be brought about how do you start with your compound how do you check for various stress karma and some of the industry which has taken actually initiative has been paradoxically cosmetics which are not supposed to do anything actually so but cosmetic industry has been developing hormatic uh interventions but they don't openly are able to say that except one company who says that so hormones for health not targeting any specific disease just like exercise is not targeted against a disease it will never cure a disease it will try to give your whole system its own way to manage health and improve health and that itself is a big issue what is health so i'm just giving these three latest books from our book series on three and hermeses how do we talk about health how do we measure health what are the foods rule etc but in my understanding after having life-long research career in aging i think we have to talk in aging about how to improve health it doesn't mean that we don't need these anti-disease approaches disease approaches are they are acute they are needed now that's a matter of life and death for an individual but if we want to do anything about aging please think in terms of how it will help me to improve health and that area will be more acceptable to the public also anti-aging slogans don't work they just frighten me oh otherwise this disease and that is it i think i have used up my time thank you very much [Music] you
