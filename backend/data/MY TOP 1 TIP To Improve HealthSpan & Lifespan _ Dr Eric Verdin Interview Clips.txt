[Music] yes i'm pretty convinced about exercise and when i say exercise it is you know for a lot of people it means sweating it means you know going to the gym things that many people frankly do not like there's incredibly compelling data showing the effect of simple walking and i you know i i was struck by the whole the whole fitbit craze with the 10 000 steps and having you know been one of the early adopters i i tested this you know to walk the thousand step is is there's a lot of walking every day which means that for most people will buy their fitbit they will try they will be successful for a month or two and then they will get discouraged and then it will go from 10 000 to 1200. and so i you know i research a little bit to see where is this 10 000 step coming from it actually came from an initial app that was a pedometer that's something that you could wear on your belt that was sold in japan in the 50s or 60s and and they they were the first one to recommend 10 000 step turns out some colleagues have actually looked at the data trying to see predict people's longevity as a function of the number of steps and what they found was actually somewhat different is that most of the benefits of walking actually occurred within the first 5 000 steps and that's that by itself was a remarkable finding because again we talked about earlier the realization that most of your longevity is determined by by your activities walking five thousand step a day is is relatively easy and and so this is part of my routine you know take a walk with the dog in addition to the sports that i do independently i just try to do the walking and i encourage people if you're not walking at all start walking 15 minutes every day and then 20 and then you know typically you know i do this with my mother who is not an exerciser and was complaining you know she's 87 and was complaining about aches and pains and and inflammation and so on and i i got her to start walking 15 minutes a day and it just made an amazing difference even just on her psyche on everything i i think you know medici exercising is is the best anti-aging medicine that we have today clearly and personally what i try to do is if you're asking me what my tip is because the bottom line is when i exercise a lot i can eat anything i want which is so that eliminates the second variables almost anything i want but i i think i try to combine a variety of exercises that addresses all of the needs that your musculoskeletal system needs and that would be endurance cardio type of exercise so the longer long low level duration i do some strength training so you know you don't need much equipment you don't need a gym you can just buy you know a couple of dumbbells and a medicine ball and this is all you have to to have and there are classes everywhere on youtube on you know everywhere you look there there's a new class that's free or you're going to join a gym if you if you you know if you're more social i think it's important to include balance you know we talked about fancy things in the aging research field but typically people die from falling which is really it strikes me to this point that and they die from falling because they lose a proprioceptive sensation in their feet with peripheral neuropathy they and they don't train so your balance is something that you can start training for your whole life standing on one foot doing exercises that are linked to balance and finally flexibility so you know i love yoga pilates all of these forms of exercise incorporate a little bit of flexibility a little bit of balance a little bit of strength and so i encourage you know all of your listeners to try to find something that they can stick with and i mean the quality of their life will clearly increase [Music] you
