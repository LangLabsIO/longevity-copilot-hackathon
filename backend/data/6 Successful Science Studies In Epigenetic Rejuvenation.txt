[Music] the reason is a couple of years ago Greg Fahey published a human clinical trial a phase one study which was a bit controversial among the Aging researchers and why because he had developed a cocktail of human growth hormone metformin DHEA and vitamin D and administered it to these individuals and observed epigenetic rejuvenation and um now near basil I mentioned that that was due to metformin but in this talk we now talk about growth hormone it was paradoxical it's it's it was a conundrum why is it that increased levels of circulating igf-1 in these adult males were associated with the lower epigenetic age instead of the opposite you know and um so yeah I I like that for this result that the liver specific growth hormone knockout mice which also obviously have lower igf-1 levels but they there was no effect on epigenetic age so in certain ways we have decoupled circulating igf-1 levels from epigenetic clocks in these mice you know and and in that clinical trial and the punch line seems to be that timing is really everything um so when you administer one intervention during a developmental phase let's say between weeks one and eight in a mouse early postnatal development um that may be beneficial but then later in life that same intervention may actually be bad for you you know I mean it's all trivial stuff antagonistic pleiotropy but I think that's what we observe also in these epigenetic clock studies I talked a lot about dwarf mice and yes dwarf mice show slower epigenetic aging but um what about the opposite they're these human um disorders human overgrowth disorders such as sotos syndrome and tatin brown Raman syndrome which have interestingly been shown to exhibit positive increased epigenetic age acceleration so it's beautiful right dwarf mice slower epigenetic age overgrowth disorders increased epigenetic age so overall I think this by now strong evidence that epigenetic clocks relate to this somatotropic axis and um I remind you apart from dwarf mice um many of us have shown that caloric restriction slows epigenetic aging or conversely high fat diet obesity increases epigenetic age so it all ties in with that idea this is um I want to remind you um one of the strongest interventions to reset epigenetic age are the yamanaka factors oskm so here I'll show you the results for our pan mammalian clock applied to human fibroblasts and after 11 days of administering these oskm factors then we start to see the decrease so maybe one needs to wait quite a while to to see Rejuvenation now I want to talk about what um I call Gold Standard perturbations of epigenetic clocks pro-aging high fat diet in Mouse liver your age the liver faster Down syndrome is there a couple of Progeria that relate to um epigenetic logs but not all the market exceptionists Hutchinson's Guilford but um anyways trisomy 21 no question now anti-aging caloric restriction in Mouse liver and then I showed you the dwarf mice and I want to briefly talk about parabiosis and overall it relates to this Hallmark of Aging that we call cell cell communication and there by now is quite some literature that says that yes cell cell communication very much affects epigenetic clocks um there was one study by Harold ketcher and sangavi um Akshay sangavi who showed that a plasma fraction young plasma fraction administered to rats rejuvenated the rats and then Vadim gladyshev and Bohan Zhang um have shown that parabiosis experiments in female female black six mice also show this rejuvenating effect and then more recently consio eloborus showed that um stem cell derived extra cellular vesicles administered to mice rejuvenate various Mouse tissues and finally there was a human clinical trial by James Clement that showed that so yeah overall um so young blood in essence seems to or young plasma seems to rejuvenate several organs in multiple species foreign [Music]
