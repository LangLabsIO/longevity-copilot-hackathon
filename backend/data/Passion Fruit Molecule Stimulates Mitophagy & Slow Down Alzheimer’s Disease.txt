[Music] this s we wondered are there any small molecules maybe you know have similar or even better results this one is supported by a a molecule and U was led by a post of fellow Shin she lived in Thailand so she found that there are a lot of epidemic regulation uh study showing when you eat a lot of colorful fruits it correlates with better quality of life and a lower chance to get dementia and she wanted to know whether this is coincidence or because there are still some molecules can be potential anti ad drug candidates and she isolates many compounds and this lead one CA e AA uh so she showed that in this MIT QC mitage uh Mouse model we saw Ault dependent increase of mitage in the brain of the Y type U mice as well as increased the filation P6 uh uh ubin 65 as a mark of pink one based mitage uh we did a lot of experiments but I want to share with you this 3D human brain in a dish uh it's ad ipsc to differentiate to neurons and asides then added the red ones will be here micro gar and a culture them together uh in collaboration with Dr heno so we showed that uh this model recapitulates top pathology as evidenced by high levels of P 2017 and our molecule EFA dramatically reduced top pathology it also reduced inflammation as evidenced by lower migration of the red Mia into the center possibly because of reduced a beta ples a beta peptide as well as lower inflammation uh we are so excited on those results so then we use the more than half a year and worked with a Dutch company tried to ask what is the pharmacokinetics of this molecule where it can pass a blood BR uh barrier and we're so fortunate to show that um after tra in red and the half uh the half life is 10.1 hours so so close to that 12 to 24 hour half life uh preferred by the uh pharmaceutic companies and we also showed that after two hours injection through the V were able to detect uh this EFA in the uh cortex region of the mice indicating you was able to pass the blood brain [Music] barrier
