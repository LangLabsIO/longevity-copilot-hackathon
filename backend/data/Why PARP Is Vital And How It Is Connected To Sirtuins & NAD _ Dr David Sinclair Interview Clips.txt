[Music] enzyme right this is a polyadp ribose polymerase and and should we talk about parp a little bit and how it connects with all this uh yeah what's really interesting is that it works in concert with the sirtuin right and they all need nad this molecule right aquarius in the body so parp uh there are about 15 or so par enzymes we don't know what they all do we're studying some of them in my lab part 14 looks pretty interesting to us [Music] so part one is the one that's most studied and most important for this topic and it's a dna repair facilitator and it will go to a broken dna molecule and tell the rest of the proteins this is a problem come fix this it's a marker and so you can see it come on one of the things that we found actually is that its activity goes down with age uh coincident and probably caused by lower levels of nad as the animals got older and what we found was that by raising the levels of nad the fuel for the enzyme park uh that we could restore the activity of dna repair um and so yeah pop is really important it's often forgotten there's a big uh a lot of interest about nad of course and people ask me about the sotuance but you're the first person who's ever asked me about the parks and they're they're probably just as important for this story a.d so our bodies are actually destroying nad through pops and sort of and then they're recycling it back from nicotinamide all the time it's called the nad salvage pathway [Music] you
