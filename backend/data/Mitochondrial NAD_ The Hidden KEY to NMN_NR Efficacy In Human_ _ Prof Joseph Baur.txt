[Music] so I'm going to tell you about some of our work on NAD uh and the reason we originally got interested in this uh is this diagrammed here on this slide um there is not a whole lot of evidence in humans yet but the evidence that exists um strongly supports the idea that there is an age- related decline in NAD levels uh at least in some tissues the examples here are there skin brain muscle and liver um all of these in human data uh and so of course this has been recapitulated many times in rodent models uh and we are very interested in in developing um a lot more data to see exactly when and where uh NAD levels are falling in humans uh but this really creates the idea that it might be beneficial to supplement NAD and get back to a youthful level so we've heard NAD discussed uh a few times already but we haven't heard a whole lot about what it does um which turns out to be pretty uh important and complicated so NAD really has two major facets that people have studied it was discovered as a Redux co-actor that mediates the cycle on the right hand side of the slide uh where for it Powers things like glycolysis ba oxidation and the TCA cycle it accepts the high energy electrons and transfers them for instance to complex one of the electron transport chain and mitochondria to fuel respiration to things like laced dehydrogenase where reducing power is needed to catalyze different biochemical reactions uh and so because these multiple roles in metabolism there's no sustainable path to ATP generation that doesn't involve NAD uh and it becomes pretty self-evident that no cell can survive without NAD in fact we know this that even if you become severely deficient in NAD that's fatal uh that's the cause of the disease peligra that was cured uh by the discovery of vitamin B3 which is nasin and nicotinamide uh the precursors to NAD on the left side of this diagram is the more recently appreciated role goal of NAD as a co-substrate for signaling uh reactions so things like pars cd38 C tuin degrade NAD release the nicotinamide mo uh and throw various molecular switches within cells signal things like calcium homeostasis uh gene silencing and expression and because we have these enzymes constantly degrading NAD as part of their signaling mechanism uh we have to have a salvage pathway that's active all the time in cells to regenerate NAD from nicotinamide the existence of these two opposing path ways creates the possibility that they're going to get out of whack at some point so in different disease processes or we think during the normal aging process um you can have a degradation of NAD that exceeds the capacity for synthesis and you can potentially change the size of this NAD pool um that may in fact have Direct effects through these signaling enzymes but at least my point of view uh at the moment is that the most prominent effects that this is likely to have are by just decreasing the amount of this pool that's available for the energetic reactions on the right this the primary metab olic role of NAD which I think is really the the most essential so when starting to think about ways that we boost NAD some of the obvious things are we know there's a denovo pathway from triptan uh but this is not a really attractive way to supplement because tryptophan also is a precursor for neurotransmitters uh for immune modulators only about 160th of the tryptophan flux in your body is going through NAD and so you can have a lot of unintended consequences if you try to supplement that way um you can supplement nasin uh which is one of the vitamin B3 forms that has been done traditionally this has some unpleasant side effects including flushing that leads some people to discontinue it um but it is effective in boosting NAD levels you can also supplement nicotinamide and a lot of excitement about the idea of Now using nicotinamide mononucleotide which is an intermediate NAD synthesis or nicotinamide rabde which is an alternative precursor that can come in through this other arm of the pathway and each of these molecules has the advantage that it's already ribos elated and so you're bypassing this rate limiting step catalyzed by nmpt which is also the most energetically costly and this is an enzyme that's feedback inhibited by NAD levels itself and so there's an intrinsic limit to how much NAD you can get coming from nicotinamide but you can bypass that if you come in from the side with these other precursers so a lot of people have had this idea at this point I think it also highlights the point that we really don't know a lot about how these effects are working NAD has all these about 500 different reactions that are well characterized that are NAD dependent in cells um and in most cases we have no idea which one's taking place uh that's relevant to the effects we don't know which tissues or cells are mediating the effects of the supplements and so for instance one of the first things that was reported was that NAD supplements were boosting endurance in mice we've shown since genetically that if you do that specifically in skeletal muscle that's not enough to confer the effect it's probably mediated through a hypothalamic circuit and so some of the assumptions we're making in many cases when we try to move into humans may be incorrect and we really need to understand what the target tissue or cell type that we're trying to boost NAD in is if we want to be able to evaluate these human studies and understand if we're getting the same mechanisms engaged um we need to know a lot more about how the the precursors are metabolized in Vivo so we've been doing a lot of this kind of work in mice and the answers have been really surprising in many cases uh oral precursors are ending up in the microbiome uh getting disassembled Rings separated and and reassembled by the time they show up in tissue and pools um and it really um argues that it's going to dramatically affect the outcome depending on how you deliver these things um and maybe what your microbiome composition is at the time when you're delivering them so we need this kind of data in humans which we don't have yet um but I think is going to be really important to understand exactly what we're doing in these supplementation trials um I think this the point already made that there's at least 500 reactions that are NAD dependent and in almost no cases we know which one we think is is being affected uh for these beneficial effects is almost all cases of supplement the whole body with as much NAD as you can get in in the rodents and then we see a beneficial outcome so we we really need to get down to this nitty-gritty level of knowing what the target is that we can evaluate in humans um and finally the last point that I'm going to focus on today is uh understanding which pools of NAD within the cell are most critical we know there's at least five distinct pools of NAD within the cell that are membrane bound and separate um they're obviously being used for different types of metabolism or different metabolic processes within those different compartments and in almost every case we're actually looking at a mashed up piece of tissue when we determine the NAD levels and not understanding whether we might have hit a Target organel so one of the ones that I think is the most interesting to follow up on for this point is mondria and I'll show you some evidence here even from that first slide where I showed the Cycles U much of the NAD catalyzed metabolism is taking place inside the mitochondria um and this is evidence that one of the first things we see in a lot of the cells treated with NAD boosters is an improvement in mitochondrial respiration in this case they were treated just for 5 hours so this is about the time when the NAD level in the cell Peaks and even by that time before you've had a whole lot of time for remodeling the proteome or anything like that um you can immediately see a boost in mitochondrial respiratory capacity either in the intact cells um or if we isolate the mitochondria uh and then then look at their ability to respire maximally So based on that line of thinking we' got interested a few years back understanding how mitochondria get NAD and at the time there were three ideas in the field um either that mitochondria just completely synthesized their own that they take up nicotinamide mononucleotide as an intermediate and complete the synthesis um or that they directly import NAD from the cytool and so we were able to show with Tracer studies uh that at least this third pathway exists and seems to be critical for many cell types we can't rule out the possibility that these first two happen under certain circumstances uh but we think this third one is really the major mechanism that there's a direct uptake and based on those Tracer studies we began searching for one uh and in 2020 uh we along with nor cor's group uh and the apari uh superti ferga group um here in Europe uh simultaneously reported that slc25 A51 uh is that mitochondrial NAD transporter in mamalian cells and so this is just the proof of principal experiment with the ha one cells where we've looked at whole cell NAD which is completely unchanged by knocking out this Gene uh but if you isolate mitochondria from those cells you can see it's is really at a very low level and as you might predict from that if we look at oxygen consumption as a measure of mitochondrial function in these cells uh it's near zero all the time so this is data from a seahorse this is oxygen consumption rate and we're putting the cells through their Paces with uh uh different Inhibitors and activators of mitochondrial function in the wild type but you don't need to know those because the The Knockout elves are just dead the whole time they really can't respire at all even though they are in fact alive and continue to proliferate powered completely by glycolysis so that's a bit of an extreme example because there's almost no Ned in the mitochondria um but we can also show that in hepatocytes or heaty derived cell lines if we use shrna to knock down the transporter here so only by about 50% we can get a decrease in the NAD pool that looks a little bit more reasonable and physiological in fact if we look at circadian rhythms you get about this much variation in NAD levels to begin with and that's also sufficient to limit mitochondrial respiratory capacity so you can see here a drop in the OCR that is about proportional to the drop in NAD in those mitochondria and so we think that HPA asite mitochondria at least are really acutely sensitive to the amount of NAD that's present and it really limits the amount of flux that's possible through the organ LS and so having this information in hand it allows us for the first time to ask whether shifting NAD into the mitochondria is sufficient to reproduce the effects of supplementation so we really wanted to ask if you if you don't boost NAD everywhere in fact you don't even increase the total amount of NAD but you just increase the amount that's in the mitochondria so they can respire better will that be sufficient to explain some of the beneficial effects that we see with the different supplementation strategies and the system we chose to do that in was liver regeneration with a 2/3 paral hepatectomy and we chose this because we had seen um robustly over many sets of experiments that this system stresses the NAD pool NAD levels fall in the regenerating liver and that if you supplement NAD levels in this case with nicotinamide rabde um you can accelerate the rate of recovery and of liver regeneration both the number of replicating hepatocytes at the liver weight to body weight ratio and if you look histologically it's just kind of a night and day response in terms of being able to deplete all the fat droplets that accumulate in the regenerating liver uh and being able to pick out more U doiing cells as you can see there's one here in the center we were also excited about using this system in particular uh because we had observed previously that there is a response in the regenerating liver to relocate NAD to the mitochondria so this is the whole liver NAD result that I mentioned where when you regenerate NAD is dropping um but if you look at the mitochondria from the same time Point uh NAD is actually going up even though the total pool's going down so it seems like the liver actually in response to the Regeneration wants to put more NAD into the mitochondria so this is the experiment that we set up to test the hypothesis uh we used viral overexpression of slc25 A51 in the livers of mice uh and then without adding any supplementation just shifting their endogenous NAD into the liver asked whether that would promote regeneration the same way that NAD supplements do so this is just a demonstration that that we don't really affect whole liver Ned you're looking at the blue bars here compared to the black um and if you look at mitochondrial NAD isolated from hepatocytes that is actually significantly higher in the animals that are transduced uh and I'm not sure whe you can see the whole liver data but here is the data which essentially says that just shifting NAD into the mitochondria without adding any more of the system is sufficient to completely recapitulate the benefit that we see with nicotinamide Rob aide so here's liver weight to body weight ratio again here's the mitotic index the number of replicating hepatocytes uh and if you look histologically here you can see again it looks really just like the effects that we get from from nicotinamide RAB aside supplementation and so this really seems to be the key effect that we're getting is pushing a little bit of NAD into the mitochondria when we supplement um here's the data just showing that NAD levels do remain high both pre post U hepatectomy uh and nadh follows about the same pattern so there's not a major shift in the Redux State the ratio between NAD and nadh there's really just more of both in about the same ratio uh that's maintained throughout the Regeneration process uh and that translates to increased activity uh of complex one in the mitochondria or increased total complex one dependent respiration so we see that even pre hepatectomy so consistent with the cell culture data if we boost NAD levels we do get a statistically significant but subtle increase in mitochondrial respiratory capacity to begin with uh and then after the hepatectomy as NAD levels are falling uh we start to lose capacity but we can dramatically restore that by having more NAD in the mitochondria which is consistent with it being able to regenerate better uh finally this is some in progress data using heterozygous mice for A51 uh which I thought was important to show just again to make this argument that hepatocytes are sitting at that level of NAD where they really are acutely sensitive to Small Change so even heterozygosity for this Gene which I thought wouldn't be enough to do anything um actually is strongly trending towards lowering mitochondrial NAD in the liver and has all the opposite phenotypes to what we see with overexpression in the liver um so so either up or down regulating the amount of NAD and hepatite mitochondria seems completely sufficient to to mediate this phenotype and so with that I will just conclude and say I hope convinced you that mitochondrial respiration is sensitive to NAD levels in HPA ites in both directions uh mitochondrial NAD levels that we set by the gene expression of slc25 A51 seem to be sufficient to determine liver regeneration in Vivo and that we think mitochondrial NAD may be the relevant therapeutic Target uh in many other applications which are interested in testing but we really want to see how General this Paradigm turns out to be uh and if this is the case mitochondrial NAD is a small fraction of tissue NAD and so the surrogates that we're using to to evaluate supplementation may not be the right ones if it's really the Met n that we need to [Music]
