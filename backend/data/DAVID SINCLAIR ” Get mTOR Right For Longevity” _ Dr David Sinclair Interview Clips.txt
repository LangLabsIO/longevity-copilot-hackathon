so [Music] whatever you know what i'm saying and so but then there's this role of something called mtor that comes into play you know so and nutrition is involved in that so can you talk a little bit about this mtor yeah so imtar mtor is the second uh leg on the the three-legged stool uh i mentioned sirtuins yeah mtor is is probably the the most important to get right but they will talk to each other but this is a really key one uh mtor is sensing how many amino acids are in your body particular amino acids leucine isoleucine uh branched chain amino acids and if you're always eating meat every day your mtor will be active mtor is there to to grow new body parts it's there to grow larger taller when you're developing the problem is if you're always feeding it amino acids and trying to bulk up yeah you'll get great big muscles and you'll look great but the long-term effect of that we've seen in animals at least is that you're not harnessing your body's defenses your longevity genes the mtor isn't in this case you want to turn it off you want to down play it because a low m tour predicts longevity and so that's why i'm mostly focusing on plant-based foods as much as i can but when i need to bulk up and if i work out typically every sunday then i will eat meat but give like you said give your body a rest mix it up so mtor is that's it's not talked about enough and especially in the kind of conventional health circles and fitness circles but this is one of the reasons we need protein and but the great news is that a small amount can go a long way is what i'm hearing well it is it is and you don't need to restrict everything it's important to give yourself the ability to repair itself but if you're always in this rebuild mode always body building mode which you know you'll end up looking great but it actually comes down to vanity versus longevity if you're only you only care about vanity you're going to miss out on the longevity part so this is the trick is to do the exercise do the weight lifting you need that um i need to do a lot more but i do it on weekends but then give your body a break you don't want to work out hard every day we know that yeah you don't want to eat three meals a day we believe that's bad um and so we have to overturn what we thought which was more is always better [Music] [Applause] [Music] you
