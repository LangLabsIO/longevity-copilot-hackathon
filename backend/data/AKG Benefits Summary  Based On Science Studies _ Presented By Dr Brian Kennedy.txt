[Laughter] [Music] and the molecule that we that gave us the biggest effect out of a screen of about 40 different natural products that had been linked to aging in one way or another was alpha ketoglutarate and uh so the initial studies were done in worms looking for compounds that worked and had additive effects but this is the study the first study on alpha ketoglutarate uh many years ago now published in nature showing quite a big effect of this metabolite on longevity in c elegans and uh we're able to repeat this effect but i'm not going to show you our worm data today for the sake of time that was mostly performed in gordon's lab i'll show you the mouse data which we did a lot in our lab and this was a graduate student azar that worked a lot on this she just got her phd and uh so this she was co-trained by gordon and i so we looked for when we didn't switch to mouse studies to validate what we thought in worms we started interventions at 18 months this is kind of following the original rapamycin study showing that a relatively late intervention could still have an effect on aging and given that this is around the time we want to do clinical studies we thought that might be a good time for the intervention in mice as well now if you just looked at this slide you wouldn't see a anything that gets you extremely excited there is an effect on lifespan there's about a 10 extension of females five percent in males this is cohort one we've done a second cohort and got the same effect but that's a relatively modest effect the thing that really jumps out about alpha-ketoglutarate is its effect on health span and frailty and so we're using susan howlett's uh frailty index this 31 point index that was published several years ago that's becoming more popular uh and uh we measured frailty either in the control animals or the alpha ketoglutarate treated animals the controls are in blue and the akg is in magenta and you can see as the months go by the control animals get more frail than the ikg treated animals but this is a very complicated way of presenting this data because we're not accounting really for the animals that are dying along the way by the time you get to two years of age some of the animals are beginning to die and for instance this point on the controls here this animal has a very high frailty but is not present in the 25 month time point because the animal's dead so after all the animals dead we went back and recalibrated this by calculating at what point during the animal's lifespan we measured the frailty either between 50 and 60 60 and 70 70 and 80 80 and 90 and 90 and 100 and what you can see is you get a much more linear response the frailty response and the control animals it goes up steadily with age and it's strikingly reduced in the akg treated animals there's about a 50 reduction in females i'm not showing males but there's about a 40 to 45 reduction in males so you see almost equivalent effects on frailty in both sexes and so what we would like to argue from this is that this natural product or metabolite is compressing morbidity it's keeping the animals healthy very late in life and also extending lifespan but the frailty effect is bigger than the lifespan effect another way of plotting this is to to take all of the frailty measures and plot versus the remaining lifespan of the animal so we've ignored the longitudinal component here and just plotted all the data points and what you can see using the sproyalty index in blue is in the control animals frailty accurately predicts mortality both in the female and male populations but the akg animals it barely predicts fatality fatal mortality in the female animals and really has no significant prediction in the males again indicating that the frailties largely suppressed and the akg treated animals so what is akg you probably should know if you took a biochemistry class at some point this central metabolite in the tca cycle and it's a little bit like nad in the sense that it's also a substrate in hundreds of different chemical reactions in the cell and so we see an effect of akg but that doesn't lead to an obvious mechanism and there are many different potential mechanisms by which it can be affecting aging and in fact we've shown that it's associated with improved adult stem cell function we think it improves metabolic flexibility in some context we can see enhanced respiration there are alterations in the microbiome that we're just beginning to study there's a relatively robust effect on inflammation that's something i'll show one slide on and in the human studies the company is already the product's already available and we're getting feedback from people taking that we are seeing changes in the epigenetic clock but that's not in a clinically uh controlled study with those are ongoing i can tell you about them in a second uh just briefly one of the big effects we saw was on coat condition and hair growth and we were able to show that when you treat the animals with alpha-ketoglutarate the coat color may be explained by the fact that you preserve the melanocytes in the hair bulbs much later in life in the akg treated animals than the control animals so that that we see a big effect on some of the aspects of frailty and the ones involved in co condition and kyposis particularly are heavily affected uh here's the inflammatory effect these are all inflammatory cytokines starting 18 month control animals it's all set to a neutral color and you can see that the increased red and the control animals in 28 months shows increased inflammation and that's largely suppressed in the akg treated animals i want to jump to something else that most of that that data is in the paper coming out i want to jump to something else and and that's the akg and exercise performance several people are taking this are reporting to us that they have better exercise endurance um again anecdotally uh but that's not particularly surprising because there's a long literature on alpha ketoglutarate and muscle building and exercise performance the supplement may enhance athletic performance and metabolism these are just three papers i pulled off the web there are many others it's used in increasing cell growth and healing and injuries and wounds and particularly important in healing of muscle tissue um a non-essential amino acid that may be beneficial in muscle building efforts of exercising uh and so this has been in the literature for a long time but the mechanism is not entirely clear now many of the supplements bodybuilders take not only have akg but they have amino acids like arginine in them as well and i just want to be clear that we're only giving akg and these studies i'm showing you and not the amino acids which may have other effects on aging we're not sure of and one let me go back one one particular challenge in trying to understand mechanism is when we give akg to the mice or when we put it on cells in cell culture we found uh and this was already known we rediscovered that akg doesn't get in easily to cells so it's a molecule doesn't cross membranes easily and they're not necessarily mechanisms to drive akg into cells and so many cell types when you add akg it's not getting in at a very high level there is when we give it to mice we see it get into the intestine and the liver but a lot of peripheral tissues we can't detect an increase in the and the labeled akg one place though where we forgot to look in our first study was red blood cells and this paper actually was published before i was born in 1963 uh talking about utilization of alpha ketoglutarated red blood cells for glutathione synthesis so red blood cells as you know are quite different they don't have mitochondrial function and so when they still need to make molecules like glutathione in fact glutathione is particularly important in red blood cells because they're carrying lots of oxygen and many molecules can be damaged by oxidative reactions including hemoglobin itself uh and what's alpha ketoglutarate is one of the principal sources of of the glutathione production in red blood cells and in fact there have been papers out showing that akg is a better substrate to be converted into glutamate for glutathione synthesis than glutamine is and in fact in some studies up to 89 percent of the glutamate in glutathione comes from akg in red blood cells so one thing we think we're doing is increasing glutathione synthesis and we can show that so this is total red blood cells here where we're adding at time zero akg and what we can find is they do the red blood cells do take it up and you see an increase in glutathione levels over a two hour period in mice treated for a week with akg you can see increased glutathione levels both in males and females uh this is a very small number of mice now that covenant we're back in the lab after covert 19 we're trying to make this data more robust but i think it's very suggestive that we're increasing increasing glutathione function so in my view this may be one of the reasons you see better exercise endurance when you're taking akg is because you get better red blood cell function and better oxygen delivery to muscle cells so that's one of the mechanisms that may be affecting aging as well so just in the latter part of my oh let me one more slide sorry so we have two human clinical trials one going and one plan the one going is sponsored by the company and it's being done at indiana university uh the idea is to do a nine-month intervention up to 100 people 45 to 65 year old participants placebo-controlled looking at aging biomarkers and inflammatory markers and there's a similar study that we're planning at in us here in singapore except that we're only going to use akg the product has some vitamins in it as well and in this study what we would like to know are specific mechanisms that are being affected by akg so we're only using that otherwise it's a similar study so hopefully we'll have some data on that in the near future if we can get these clinical trials up and running after coven [Music] you
