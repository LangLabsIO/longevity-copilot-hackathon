so so [Music] shoot elderly people along with masks social distancing other measures take some kind of anti-aging pills which would boost their defenses ah well um i don't make recommendations i'm just a phd studying mice but i can talk about the science the science says that uh if we were to reduce the age of the body uh it should function like a young person there's no reason why that shouldn't be possible and there have been molecules one of which for example is called rapamycin that in low doses was shown to boost the older people's uh immune system and there are other ways of doing that the molecule that i work on called nad uh when you replenish that uh it's thought to improve the body's immune system and make it younger and in fact i work on mice but i also work with a company that i co-founded that is doing clinical trials across the united states in more than 28 hospitals trying to see if rejuvenating the immune system making it younger through raising nad this molecule will help in um not just eliminating eliminating the virus but preventing that over reaction to it but what kind of time time span are we talking about i mean the anti-aging supplements that you're researching that you're promoting which are so far not being certified as medicine but they surely don't work overnight right unlike masks or social distancing i mean how long before we can prove a definite connection between anti-aging supplements and human resistance to covet well so most of the treatments that we have or even the theoretical treatments which are sold as supplements work through mechanisms of slowing down aging turning on the body's natural defenses against disease which is still a big deal we've only been able to do that for the last 15 years in animals and in humans we think we can do it somewhat there's not a lot of evidence but there's there's retrospective studies of people taking a drug for example called metformin for diabetes which looks promising that's slowing aging but to work rapidly we need something that will reverse aspects of aging and it looks actually like drugs like rapamycin and potentially these nad boosting molecules i mean they won't make you look 20 tomorrow that that's not going to happen but they they can target parts of the body such as the immune system or the the lining of blood vessels and and make those cells behave as though they're young very quickly uh just to give you an example when we treat uh mice that are old with a molecule that raises nad just in a in a it was about a week or two those animals are now as fit and can run on a treadmill as far as fast and as far as a young animal um we think that with covert we can have benefits uh within days that's uh so far what the early results say um ultimately we want an age reversal injection or a pill that's of course what the ultimate dream would be uh we recently had a paper um it was on the cover of nature magazine in december that showed the first evidence that you can rewind the clock the body's epigenetic clock called the dna methylation clock sometimes known as the hormone clock you can rewind that back uh just very quickly within a matter of a week or two as well and that might be a permanent reset and then you just age out again and keep doing that reset uh to be fair we did it in mice we did it in the eye and skin we haven't done it in the immune system uh but we're hoping to try that too [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] you
