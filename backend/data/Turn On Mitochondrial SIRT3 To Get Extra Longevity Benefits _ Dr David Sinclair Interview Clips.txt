[Music] writing uh my book I I really was very skeptical that saers and cult BS could do anything for aging it seems too easy you know it's a sounded like it was uh uh hype uh as I researched it um and even more so in the last year there have been a lot of studies in in mice in rats in dogs and now in humans that convinces me that these longevity genes that I work on the cin are turned on by hot air in the lungs and on the skin um and also shocking the body with cold plunges into 4 Dee temperature for at least 3 minutes sometimes colder sometimes longer but these actually turn on these cin defenses as I mentioned there are seven of these defense enzymes that we study there is one in particular that is turned on by Cold called c 3 um and it's found in the back it's found actually it's found in throughout the body but when we are cold it will turn on and so three protects the energy Supply in the body so it turns on the What's called the mitochondria the energy packs in the cell and by being cold it actually can rev up these little machines and we know that revving those mitochondria is very important for staying young but when we're babies we have brown fat it's what keeps us warm you know baby little babies they can't shiver like we can so they this brown fat and about 15 years ago we thought only babies had Brown fat but if you look using an M or a pet scan you can actually see the brown fat in adults and if you're cold if you do these kind of cold plunges uh you can actually stimulate to have more Brown fat and brown fat is much healthier than white fat P push yourself into the uncomfortable Zone um every day do something that makes you feel uncomfortable physically and maybe even mentally and then then uh you know you'll probably get those benefits we like to feel uh safe we like to feel uh not very tired we don't like to be hungry we don't like to be hot or cold but we need to push our bodies and into this uncomfortable Zone you know maybe not you don't need to feel like you're dying but you do need to make your body feel a bit uncomfortable to get the extra longevity benefits from these genes that we have [Music] n
