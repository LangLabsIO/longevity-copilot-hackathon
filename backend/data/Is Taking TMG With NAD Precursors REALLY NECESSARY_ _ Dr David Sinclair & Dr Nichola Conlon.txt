[Music] I take glycine actually specifically trimethylglycine is is actually to counter what I think might be going on with an NAD booster now to raise energy levels what we've done in my lab to mice for the last decade is we give them precursors to NAD so we give them molecules like nicotine white riboside or NR or nicotine wide mononucleotide also known as nmn not to be confused with M M's have the opposite effect and so nmn is is what I take each day I take a gram of it but the thing with nicotinide mononucleotide nmn is that it it has this nicotinamide group on it it hangs off the the main part of the chemical and it's the first bond to break and so we see in animals and even in humans that the levels of nicotinamide go up quite rapidly after taking nmn or NR and to look two high levels of nicotinamide are not good in part because the nicotinamide gets excreted through the kidneys and it's done so that happens because it becomes methylated into methyl nicotine and methyl nicotine might have been used for for years as a marker of all sorts of things including at least experimentally for Parkinson's Disease but the concern that's that's been talked about in social media especially is is this drain of methyl nicotinamide a problem the methyl groups are are needed for the body we need methyl for a whole range of things including um antioxidants and uh so as a precaution I take trimethylglycine so that I continue to give my body a source of methyl groups now I don't know if that's true uh people ask me all the time I take it as a precaution because I know that trimethylglycine is not going to hurt me glycine is good and the other thing is methylglycine is also known as betaine uh which on human cells is very good for them including protecting them against breasts so I don't see any downside it's not an expensive molecule and the upside is that I'm preventing my body from being drained of methyl groups so I do take it as a precaution knowing that it's probably not doing anything um except goodness as we ate aidens is our cells are using more in Ed than they can make or recycle it means there's a deficit and the repair and maintenance processes down here in the cell that are actually dependent on NAD they have to fight over a limited supply of NAD this ultimately leads to damage and then to some signs and symptoms of Aging if we go back to the little diagram here what happens if you just use a supplement such as NR or nmn a precursor based supplement the precursor goes into the cell it does get converted into NAD which is why you see um companies that produce these um molecules show around a 60 increase in NAD boost with these supplements so you do get an increase in NAD but this NAD is then used up and it's broken down and as soon as it's broken down it's converted into nicotinamide and if you haven't fixed the underlying problems in the cell which are causing NAD to decline namely this reduction in the Salvage pathway because of this enzyme that's declined with age what happens is the cell has to get rid of it so it methylates it and it excretes it then if you just continue pumping more NR or more nmn in the system without trying to fix the Salvage pathway you just keep contributing to the problem because you your cells are using up this initial boost of NAD but it's getting converted into nicotinamide and then the nicotinamide has to get out of the cell so you get methyl donor depletion and this is why many practitioners will say to the clients you need to use um trimethyl glycine or something like that to get to actually stop these negative effects because the depletion in methyl groups is actually really bad for epigenetics because it's very important for altering the structure of your DNA foreign [Music] foreign [Music]
