so [Music] i know you're a big fan of you know um cryotherapy you know uh actually get being cold you know because that that's that's another way for you to put your body in a good stress right so hormesis can be in many ways if it doesn't create lasting damage to your body you'll come out of the other side stronger so that you can do it with temperature as well now there hasn't been perfect con controlled experiments about whether this really will make you live longer right that's that will take a long time but i've done the research in my lab and i've looked at other scientists and there's a lot of evidence that cold shock and sauna provide health benefits um and i love doing it anyway so what's the harm so the cold shock is is either having a cold shower or dunking into a cold bath sometimes with ice in it uh i don't like that one as much i tend to just go into a cold pool at the gym which is about four degrees celsius it's enough to make you clench but you get used to it i do that only for i go underwater i dunk my head i'm in there for maybe a minute or two it's not i'm not gonna do an iceman hof kind of thing and sitting there for too long i think that's enough the sauna actually i really like and there's a lot of good studies out of the nordic countries norway in particular and finland have studies where they they show that people who go to the sauna or in their houses have saunas uh tend to live longer and they have much better cardiovascular health um and so i think that's wonderful you know it's after a workout i really like just sweating it out i feel great afterwards after that ice bath i come out feeling invigorated now now just a word of caution there is a study that says if you shock your body with cold after an intense bodybuilding workout it can reduce the benefits and i'm still trying to figure out exactly what that means um but because i the the weights and the cold bath are in the same facility it's not like i can just go home and come back another day so i do it all on the same day um yeah but that's all i can say that i'm still doing it until i'm totally convinced that it's not worth doing i know with your son you know a lot of you guys went to the gym you went to sauna steam room jacuzzi and then jumping in in a pool and and i'm fortunate enough to have all of that in the house i have all of that in the house so i'm already planning now when it comes to getting the best benefits do you think that it's best to to go from a very hot say for example a very hot location sauna jacuzzi to a cold pool or that's beneficial separately one day i can just do sauna one day i can do food yeah nobody knows that um we know that the sort ones are turned on by cold and we know that um there are benefits with heat nobody that i know of has done what you're asking which is test one to the other but theoretically it makes sense that the bigger the shock the better so that's what i do i go from sauna to steam room to cold then into a hot tub and i think that's most likely to give me the benefits because you want to get your body out of its state of complacency the modern world around us is built so that we don't feel any discomfort the chairs are comfy the lounges are comfy we get in cars even our our luggage has wheels now can life get any easier seriously we never have to go hungry usually and so our bodies are like yeah times are good we don't need to fight back but over decades you end up with a body that starts falling apart getting diseases and is shorter lived than if you tricked the body into thinking the times were tough who in here does like the cold shower thing yeah cold showers cold water swims it's counterintuitive right because your nuts are supposed to stay at a special temperature and they seem to kind of shrink up and go up inside your body and you have like that seinfeld scene but the idea is it's actually really good for a variety of things like nitric oxide production fat loss decreasing inflammation but it also increases testosterone right so i do a five minute i took one before i came here five minute cold shower every day right or some kind of some kind of a cold soak cold bath anything like that you don't have to do the whole like wim hof protocol you don't have to do the fire breathing you don't have to walk up mount kilimanjaro barefoot in your underwear but even something as simple as like a cold water shower for five minutes a day has a really really profound effect um a few other things you can do like i mentioned wear loose boxes or go commando avoid sitting for long periods of time sleep in a relatively cold room temperature i do this i'll whenever i walk into a hotel room or any anywhere i'll decrease the temperature to somewhere like you know anywhere in the range of like 16 to 19 degrees celsius and what that does is it actually not only causes your nervous system to repair and recover more quickly while you're asleep and you get better levels of deep sleep i quantify all my sleep using this ring so every morning i can wake up and i can see how something i did affects my sleep and cold temperature is a huge game changer for sleep but the cold shower before you go to bed or early in the morning that helps out uh they sell something called a chili pad which if you if you have like a bed that you sleep in a lot you can put one of these pads underneath it that circulates cold water under the bed which is really cool and even comes with like a separate pad for your partner so they could sleep out whatever temperature they want you could sleep at whatever temperature you want but all sorts of things like that to keep your body cool while you sleep can be really effective uh so hot cold contrast showers that would be like 20 minutes of cold followed by 10 seconds of hot that you do like 10 times through really good for fat loss really good for decreasing inflammation but if you keep it cold the whole time i get better results when it comes to fat loss especially when it comes to like wakefulness and stuff afterwards so i don't do the hot cold contrast um i just avoid taking a hot shower almost ever unless i've been snowboarding or hiking really cold or i'm just like shaking in blue when i come in from the outside like being in the snow i just don't take a hot shower period it's a real game changer for everything from like your stress resilience uh your cold tolerance your inflammation nitric oxide fat loss that's a cool rule to live life by don't take a hot shower unless it's absolutely necessary [Music] [Applause] so [Music] [Applause] [Music] so [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] [Applause] you
