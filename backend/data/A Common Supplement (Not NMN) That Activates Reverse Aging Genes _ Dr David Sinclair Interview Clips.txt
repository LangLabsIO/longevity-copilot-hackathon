[Music] this is an amazing Groundswell of interest in the ability not just to understand why we age but as I wrote on my book why we don't have to and this breakthrough was the ability to turn on and we discovered three genes in particular were very safe to be able to reverse aging by about 60 to 75 percent these three genes are called oct4 sox2 and klf4 we call them O S and K for short and these osk genes are normally only switched on in embryos they keep stem cells Young and they're part of a set of genes that are named after a scientist called shinya yamanaka in Japan who won the Nobel Prize for the discovery of how to turn an adult stems adult cell like a skin cell get back into a stem cell but what we did was we we reasoned that if we took just a few of those genes we wouldn't make our bodies go back to a stem cell because that would turn us into a tumor it would take us partially back and it's in in a safe way and rejuvenate the cell without making the cell lose its identity and become a Cancer and that worked so what one interesting molecule is called Alpha ketoglutarate and it is a a molecule that's typically used by the body as part of an energy cycle it's also used to make amino acids it's it's a pretty common molecule but what was discovered is that those three genes that we reversed aging with um in the mouse and in human cells uh can be activated or assisted by this alpha ketoglutarate or AKG and if you put it on human cells their age goes backwards we can measure that very accurately Now by reading the chemical changes on the genome on the DNA um and so Alpha ketoglutyride seems very safe uh you can take it as a pill and there are some I would say early uh and in need of verification studies that show that the the age of the blood in people that take this molecule goes backwards um by years in fact and alpha-ketoglutarate if you feed that to mice they actually live longer and are healthier well this isn't my research we're doing research but what I'm telling you is research that's out of other labs Brian Kennedy is a leader in this field he's over in Singapore I trained with him in the 1990s so it's I know him very well in his research and I trust him and so I think this is an example of the future where there will be a cocktail of molecules safe ones that you can take and the doctor will or you can measure at home your age I've developed a test that you can take a cheek swab mail in your DNA or the cells and you'll get a number of your your biological age and then you can with your doctor or even without you can monitor your agency if you're going backwards in age with this simple test [Music] foreign
