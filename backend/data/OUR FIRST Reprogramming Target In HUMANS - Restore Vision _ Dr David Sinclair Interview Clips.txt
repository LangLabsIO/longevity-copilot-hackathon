[Music] the discovery of the ability to enhance the body's repair systems and to rejuvenate the body has come out of aging research but this could be applied to most diseases that i can even think of we're going to target the eye glaucoma first but that will pave the way for other rejuvenation processes whether it's rebuilding a new liver skin spleen the sky's the limit at this point we're only held back by our imagination and hopefully some uh some luck along the way so i don't i don't yet think there's a limit i will see of course uh but given that result i am optimistic that we're not just talking about helping fresh wounds or wounds that are not wounds diseases that have just begun i i think as long as the neurons are still intact and haven't died then we have every chance of reprogramming them to get back their youthful function and it's been very successful if we look histologically at the back of the eye when we treat it those nerve cells that get the gene therapy almost always have the benefit it's not that oh only five percent work literally every time a cell gets this treatment it gets rejuvenated and so i'm really optimistic if we can infect a large amount of the retina in humans 30 40 maybe 50 then we should have a great chance of restoring vision as to how long it lasts uh we've we've gone out a few weeks but we don't know if it's going to last for years but one reason for optimism is that those those chemical additions that i talked about the dna methylation what we're doing is we're stripping those away and typically those changes last for decades in fact that that's why the cell uses those methyl chemicals so that a cell in your brain that's programmed to be a nerve cell will stay a nerve cell for most of your lifespan and so the that's why i think that we're going to need one reset of the retina an optic nerve and then i presume the disease will come back maybe it'll be five ten years and then it could be that your doctor prescribes you another round of the antibiotic that turns the genes on for three weeks and then you get reset again and we just we don't yet know how many times you can reset the age of a complex tissue like the eye but i don't see any theoretical reason why we couldn't do it many many times the good news is we have tested this treatment intravenously as well and there's no sign of any toxicity no sign of tumors at all after a year in mice at just blasting these genes for instead of for three weeks which we do in the eye blasting it for a year uh but i'm not keen on on trying to find you know universal cure for aging at this point i mean theoretically we could all go to my lab uh and inject ourselves with this stuff and see what happens but that would be kind of risky so instead our focus at the company there's a company that i co-founded it's called iduna it's the name of the greek goddess of not greek uh nordic goddess of longevity at iduna we are committed to treating glaucoma as the first disease and all of our experts almost all of our experts are are expert in that we are doing other studies um in collaboration with uh the mass eye and ear scientists that i mentioned uh in diseases such as macular degeneration as well and we have some early promising results there but yeah i mean we're we've been working on this now for 18 months and glaucoma we're well we're way ahead in uh in our research there [Music] you
