[Music] breath clock is thought to be just a clock on the wall it tells you how old you or what time it is or how old you are biologically but nobody had thought that that clock was actually controlling time you change the clock it's not going to make you young again right that would be ridiculous we we disagree we thought that if if we move the clock backwards and restore the the pattern of the methyl groups and if we could get the so two and proteins that have been lost back to where they were when we were young that could truly rejuvenate and send us back a decade or more and so we looked and looked and we found a set of three genes that work safely we're standing on the shoulders of juan carlos belmonte who in 2016 showed that you could rejuvenate a short-lived mouse and make it live longer by putting in four different genes we use three of those genes to reset the clock and we can reset the clock in any part of the body we chose the eye initially because the eye after a certain young age doesn't regenerate but we thought if we could wind the clock back in the eye it might grow back it might get functional again and we could even repair a broken nerve and we we did that we pinched off the nerve at the back of the eye turned on three what are called yamanaka factors which we believe reprogram the clock to be young and now those nerves started to regrow back back to the brain that was exciting but we did something else that was exciting even more exciting we said if we're actually working on aging and reversing it we should be able to take an old mouse that can't see because it's blind with its retina being old and make those nerves at the back of the eye young again and the mouse should see again and we did it and it worked mice could see again and uh it wasn't just a fluke because we could read the genes in the back of the eye the genes were going back to the their youthful structures and we really did have the polish and the polish was working and the cell could read the genes again it was brilliant and we're starting to understand what's behind the clock what's behind those hands that when we move them back time actually goes backwards yeah so this is the big breakthrough uh that we've had in the last uh few years in my lab and it's it's all in in the book actually it was great to write the book while we were making these discoveries last year what we found was that the um the reset program worked better than we thought that it really went back to a young age but it raises the question where is that information held so that remember this horvath clock is a bunch of chemicals called methyls on dna now if you were to turn a cell into a stem cell which is what most people use these genes for you'd strip all the methyl chemicals off it would be like instead of tuning a guitar you'd rip the strings off now we're not ripping the strings off we're actually tuning the guitar so we the cell takes off this methyl but leaves this one and adds one here it's it's as though the cell knows exactly how to play the symphony again and which which scratches to remove but not too deeply now where that information is held we don't know uh we know it's there somewhere we're looking it could be at the level of chemicals on the dna it could be proteins that are involved in the wrapping could be sortuns these proteins we've worked on these longevity genes but that's the holy grail right now is to find where's that information locked up so we can open it up we know that some organisms can already do that we know that if you cut the arm off an axolotl a salamander it'll grow back we know if you mush up a jellyfish it'll grow back but we've lost that ability but i think we're tapping into those ancient abilities now [Music] [Applause] you
