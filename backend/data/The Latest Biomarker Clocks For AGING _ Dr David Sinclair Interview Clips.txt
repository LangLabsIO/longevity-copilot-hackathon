[Music] so there are various clocks uh the dna methylation one is the most popular but you can measure immune age you can measure glycation which is very sugars being put on proteins uh you can also measure frailty in animals and people and use machine learning to get numbers you can do transcriptomics uh you can do blood biomarkers which is what i've been doing for over a decade so those are very important but part of the issue right now is that they're not done frequently in population studies so i'm excited that it's becoming more and more routine and that's one of the reasons that excited about bringing the cost of that test down so that we could do millions of people's clock and then truly learn what's going on uh to drive aging and perhaps things that slow it down we could discover that way but yeah it's really important that we look at these other markers as well proteomics is a new one that was just published in the last year that you can look at small proteins and large in the bloodstream and build a clock that way go back 10 years ago we well 15 years ago we had nothing all we could do was just say yeah that that animal or that person looks old and they don't walk very fast but now we have these quantitative ways of measuring aging which means that um we can make much quicker progress in understanding how to delay it and slow down and even reverse it [Music] [Music] you
