[Music] the reason that i was driven towards the epigenome was because of the sirtuins the sirtuins the the s-i-r in the words fortune stands for silent information regulator and there's information in that word so it was it was staring us in the face for 20 years um and certainly in yeast when we first discovered the sirtuins it was about gene regulation but then the field mostly forgot about that discovery and it's come back um in recent years so the sortings are part of this whole process of loss of epigenetic regulation of the genome the sirtuins normally control which genes are on and off to make you stay young and functional and healthy and they they move away they get distracted by by damaged parts of the cell like a broken chromosome and they move away and then we see that they don't always go back to where they came from like it would be um like a tennis match the balls are going back and forth between players but sometimes they get hit out of the court and get lost that's the sort so they're intimate links so by taking nad you might be stabilizing the epigenome and slowing down your aging we have some results in mice that indicate that seems to be true and there are other ways actually we think to slow down the epigenetic changes in the body uh one is alpha-ketoglutarate just came out as a remarkable study in humans that even reversed human age by uh it was eight years uh in seven months or seven months measured by the dna methylation clock though the caveat is that the math that they used is different than the rest of the fields so there's still a skepticism but even if it's only two years uh that's still a big deal because remember to be immortal you only need to go back one year every year so it's a big deal we're actually at a point now where i think that we're starting to see real human reversal of aging that's believable um but yeah to get to uh the cancer part of it the the cmic gene that we left out of our yamanaka reprogramming for aging was the key and that was the the breakthrough that led us to be able to partially reprogram and make the cells functionally younger but not so young that they forgot their identity and so we call this process of aging we call it x differentiation which means that the cells lose their their status their knowledge of what they should do and then we call it redifferentiation to bring back their identity so brain cells wake up and go oh yeah excuse the pun but i remember that i was supposed to be a nerve cell i've been behaving like partially a skin cell and a kidney cell for the last few years that's aging and then the reset is that that bringing back the memory of how a cell should behave but we don't bring it back so far that the cell goes way back to to being primordial and doesn't have its identity erased which was the key and we think it was the cmec absence that was was great uh and the real trick but what we're working on now i'll just give you a preview is that we're looking at ways to reprogram the body without genetic intervention by looking for molecules maybe it's a plant molecule out there or a few combinations of those that could reset the age of the body and that's that's truly been the dream of humanity probably since we first became conscious and so i'm not saying we're there yet but i'm saying in principle we know how to do it so [Music] you
