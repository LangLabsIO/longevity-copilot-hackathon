[Music] parks of Health this is a wonderful paper in cell Hallmarks of health and again if you look in the middle middle left lower you'll see hormetic regulation and that really is where I want to focus a discussion of uh nutrient sensing uh really mytohormesis as it affects Health span and lifespan so let's move to the next slide so Key Energy sensing targets well certainly for sensing low energy as during uh fasting starvation excessive exercise Etc uh key molecules are the sirtuins and ampk uh and that is where I will be focusing our discussion um uh when I focus on sirtuins I'm focusing primarily on cert one answer three um as they either indirectly or directly affect mitochondrial function uh I'm acutely aware of course of the uh anabolic energy sensing shown in the lower right uh where we're looking at the uh mechanistic Target of rapamycin and it of course interacts with both sertuins ampk uh as well but that will not be our Focus today move to the next slide um the key key focus of new cert has been on the amino acid leucine and our key finding has been that leucine is an allosteric activator of cert 1 and cert 3 the figure only shows cert 1 which basically causes a leftward shift in the NAD dose response curve allowing activation at concentrations of NAD that are somewhere between 50 and 80 percent lower than would otherwise be than would otherwise be possible um and this enables robust Synergy with NAD donors with certain activators um uh I let's go ahead and go to the next uh next slide thank you so our overall framework is not that leucine is going to be a sufficient nutrient sensor by itself to have a therapeutic effect but rather that leucine will co-activate other compounds and in coex activating excuse me uh it will amplify the effects of either search one activators or Downstream effectors of certain activators um and like many I have a theory of everything and my theory of everything of course covers this range of diseases from mitochondrial dysfunction to cardiovascular disease but I will limit my comments today to those that uh those that we have data for let's go to the next slide excuse me so here I'd like to spend a moment talking about leucine Synergy with NAD donors um you may have seen a fair bit of literature on NAD precursors that can be taken orally nicotinamide riboside nicotine and mononucleotide uh as sources of NAD which theoretically as activators of search one which have Downstream effects on mitochondrial function uh should show some of the same systemic benefits shown on this slide with multiple clinical trials of nicotinamide riboside in place now I think we can safely say we do not generally see the benefits that are seen in non-clinical models what we can say is that these compounds are safe uh and that they somewhat increase NAD perhaps twofold that is sufficient to uh that is simply not sufficient or appears not to be sufficient to have gluco regulatory effects lipid effects lipid oxidation effects uh or really effects on any measurable disease state so our approach has been a little different um NAD supplements or nicotinum and riboside and nicotine and mononucleotide supplements uh can basically increase NAD about twofold that's still leaves the NAD concentration in the FED State well below the km for either cert 3 or certain one so our approach is to combine these NAD donors with Lucy fairly High concentration of leucine and when we do that as you can see on the right hand part of the slide we can show an increase in lifespan in pre-clinical models an increase in fat oxidation insulin sensitivity uh in a mouse model of atherosclerosis the LDL receptor knockout Mouse we can show a reduction in atherosclerotic plaque size reduction effect a reduction in macrophage infiltration and importantly these are done at concentrations where we see no independent effects of leucine nicotine and riboside or nicotine and mononucleotide so we believe we have a means of enhancing the efficacy of excuse me enhancing the efficacy of uh NAD precursor NAD donors uh however we do not yet have clinical data to support that these are all from non-clinical Models so if you go forward one slide uh we'll take a different approach uh Resveratrol has been a molecule that oh lost count to the number of papers published on it years ago again a molecule that is shown High Hopes uh has tremendous effects in non-clinical models uh primarily as a sirtuin activator however the concentrations required uh are difficult to obtain difficult to attain we have bioavailability problems uh essentially due to Rapid metabolism of uh Resveratrol so we asked the question could we make the achievable serum levels of Resveratrol functional by adding leucine and what we've done here this is a quick summary but what we've done here is we have treated Dio mice with varying concentrations of Resveratrol with or without Lucy and when we when we do this the Resveratrol gives us nothing we are simply unless we push the Resveratrol to very high concentrations we are unable to get an effect however when we combine it with leucine what you can see in what I consider to be two two dramatic photographs uh you see pet scans of a control mouse in the upper upper left and in a leucine Resveratrol treated Mouse in the lower left and you can see the fdg lighting up uh enormously in fact we have a 60 percent increase in fdg uptake uh reduced plasma insulin and home IR by more than 50 percent uh comparable reductions in inflammatory biomarkers and along the way a solitary effect uh on body weight and adiposity and again this is at concentrations that have that we cannot this is at concentrations that show no independent effects uh when when not put together in combination um the lower right part of the slide simply shows you that in a single clinical trial in pre-diabetics we were able to improve glucose tolerance uh insulin response to a glucose load uh Homa is shown because that's all I had room for in the figure so this does translate clinically although we've not taken it Beyond pre-diabetes yet can we go to the next slide so we've also asked the question of whether we can generate a pharmacological approach and what we've done here is we've put together a combination which we call NSO 200 uh uh for which we have an IND that's been through a couple of phase two trials in which we are combining leucine low-dose metformin the starting dose of 500 milligrams and an extremely low dose of sildenafil one milligram now the the point of the sildenafil is not pde5 inhibition at very low very low doses of sildenafil really do not produce appreciable pde5 inhibition instead it is for Activation of Enos which then interacts Downstream with both certain one uh and ampk in a positive feedback feedback loop let's move to the next slide and so when we we've done clinical trials in both non-alcoholic fatty liver disease and in obesity in the upper left what you'll see is liver fat and you see a decrease in liver fat with NSO 200 uh in individuals who who have some evidence of liver disease uh full disclosure this is a study for which the primary endpoint was not met that primary endpoint was that primary endpoint was a drop in liver fat in all comers it turned out to only decrease the liver fat in individuals who had alts over 50 which was half of the cohort so some evidence of of liver disease but even in that study we showed remarkable decreases in blood pressure and triglycerides Improvement in insulin sensitivity and reductions in weight which led us to take take this forward in a separate IND for obesity and you see the for the full Co obesity cohort on the lower left and you can see a nice time dependent follow the purple line a nice time dependent decrement in body weight this is in the absence of any lifestyle modification there were subcohorts such as African Americans that had close to a six percent decrease in body weight um uh but the overall group had about a two two and a quarter percent decrease in body weight again that is without any lifestyle intervention uh we believe that with lifestyle Intervention which is the normal way you would run uh in obesity clinical trial in phase three we will achieve a much larger uh synergistic with lifestyle intervention uh decrement in weight uh let us move forward to the next slide um and I'm going to end on this slide because I'm well aware that leucine presents us with a paradox and the Paradox is leucine is considered to be an activation an activator of mtorq um uh and so why do we see the effects we see if you're supposed to be activating M2 and the answer is the concentrations that are required to activate M torque are fairly High uh in excess of one millimolar the doses that we give uh will get us to about a half millimeter um it's really hard to get to one millimolar uh fasting levels are around 0.1 millimolar uh levels following a good high protein meal is between a quarter and point three millimolar we raise it to about 0.5 millimolar and that is sufficient to activate cert 1 answer 3 without having any effects on mtor can we have measured this uh so then how do we explain the observation that it's also a marker for metabolic syndrome in some studies and the answer there is that when you look at the enzymes responsible for uh metabolism of of leucine and the other branched chain amino acids and especially focusing on on Branch chain keto acid dehydrogenase what you see is there is a block there in insulin resistant States and it is the the buildup of that metabolite keto isoproic acid that really seems to have the effects on mitochondrial dysfunction and oxidative stress however higher concentrations of leucine have been shown to activate uh Branch chain keto acid dehydrogenase so we believe this is the resolution to the Paradox but what we can say is clinically we see the effects that I've just presented and I think I've run out of time and I've been warned not to go over time so I will stop there foreign [Music]
