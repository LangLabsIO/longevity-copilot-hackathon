so [Music] one of the ways to reverse aging is to use a molecule that raises nad levels we showed early 2000s that in yeast if you raise nad production the yeast cells live longer by turning on the sirtuins the sortuan enzymes need nad we need it for life so tuans also need it and they stabilize the epigenome they repair dna and they protect mitochondria and proteins and telomeres think of certains as the guardians of our body but as we get older we lose nad production we have less of it in our skin it's estimated we have half the levels at age 50 that we had when we were 20. you can raise the levels in an animal and in a human two to three fold by giving precursors to nad nad itself we can talk about how effective that might be but these mice have been fed nmn for just four weeks in their water supply and i think you can tell the one that was drinking nmn water versus the one that wasn't the mice on the left could run 50 further and when we gave it to young mice and exercised them they ran so far the treadmill stopped working and we thought we broke it um turns out the software was never written for a mouse to run more than three kilometers so we had to rewrite the software so we figured out how we published this in 2018 we figured out how it works we think the lining of the blood vessels gets old it doesn't respond to muscle signals and what happens to us we know this is that even if we exercise when we're old we don't grow a lot of blood vessels and our organs get starved for oxygen particularly our brain and our muscles which usual and heart which use a lot of oxygen but when you give mice nmn nad levels go up cert one the the equivalent of that yeast surgeon now allows the muscle and the brain uh to signal to the blood vessels to grow so these these mice on the left have more blood vessels like a young mouse actually without even having trained [Music] [Applause] you
