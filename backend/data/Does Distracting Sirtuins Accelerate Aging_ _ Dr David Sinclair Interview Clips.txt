[Music] um so this is this was a key experiment that we did we had proposed that dna breaks that break a chromosome distract the sirtuin epigenetic regulators and they go to the break and then they have to find their way back and they don't do that efficiently and we proposed that in a cell paper in 2009 but then we had to test if that's true and the hypothesis predicted that if we create chromosomal breaks that have to be put back together multiple times even if we reestablish the genome so there's no change to the dna content the epigenome will change and it will cause aging that was the prediction and i remember people in the lab saying these mice are going to die they're going to get cancer come on that's ridiculous but you know we like to do the ridiculous uh in my lab the other thing we like to say is we make the impossible possible so we did the experiment actually my job the hardest part of my job is convincing people to do an experiment because they they take a while this is what's called an ice mouse this is the control mouse sibling was treated uh at age five months a mouse typically lives a bit over two years and then it was another 10 months after that treatment we treat them for three weeks and we accelerate their epigenome so that by 16 months of age the treated mice look like this and this is not just an old looking mouse by every measure histology biochemistry gene expression and the biological clock this mouse is older and we've done thousands of them there's it's highly reproducible and now we're working on well we've slowed this down we have ways of doing that i'll tell you but we also are working on reversing this process [Music] [Music] you
