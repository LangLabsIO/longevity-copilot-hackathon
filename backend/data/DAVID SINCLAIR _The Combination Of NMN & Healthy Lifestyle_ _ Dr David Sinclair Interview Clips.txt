so so [Music] all right so you speak a lot about the nad plus molecule last time we spoke about it in detail that's a molecule that boosts our longevity genes and protects us from aging so tell me this is just taking an 80 plus going to help me with all the bad destructive processes help result health vitality or do i still need to cut down on bad habits exercise it healthy you know all the boring stuff well so the the scientific answer is uh we we don't know uh the answer to that but what i i do is i do a combination of those things we do know that exercise and and fasting are beneficial uh to the human body so if you want to place bets on longevity those are good ones even though they're boring and sometimes painful and then the supplements what i what i think is that they they enhance that i mean very few people do perfect exercise or perfect fasting and these could enhance that um there's a little bit of data from my lab where we did at the nad boosting in combination with exercise and they added to each other the benefits and resveratrol is the same if you do resveratrol on its own versus fasting they both have health benefits if you do them together we saw a lifespan extension um quite a big one in old mice and so again i think uh that all points to the combination being the best bet because i'm thinking like on the other hand right if you cut down on bad habits and only vegetables and exercise and never smoke and never drink i mean just that it's sort of a combo perhaps that you know would allow me to live long and look great and i won't probably need any pills if if a person is able to stick to that all their lives do you know what i mean well it's a good start if you just don't do the five things that doctors uh well if you do the five things that doctors tell you to do which is uh well and you're gonna ask me that um my recollection is uh obviously don't smoke right no don't be obese okay get exercise eat the right types of food which would be mostly focusing on vegetables and not um not trans fats all that other bad stuff and then i think the last one was mental health i can't remember if it was good sleep or or lack of stress but in any case just the things that you are you know you'll read about on the internet are in newspapers those are pretty basic things those alone if you do those you'll extend your life on average by 13 years which is a big deal so it's not that hard to live longer for most people but we also know that people who live those healthy lives still will die in their 90s it doesn't give you the longevity of uh john coleman who in france made it to 122. so if you're looking for longer life than 90s and and healthy life which is the important thing long and healthy is the key because i mean you can live till you're 90 but if you're in a wheelchair or you have alzheimer's i mean i don't see a point living that long do you know what i mean well yeah not only do i know what you mean it's what i live for uh it's what i do with my life it's my career is to reduce morbidity reduce disease um and it turns out if you're not sick uh you rarely die and so longevity goes along with the health um not the other way around um typically typically medicine as its practice today in my view does things the wrong way around they will treat uh a what we call a disease a process that goes wrong they treat it after it happens rather than before and they only treat that one disease rather than try to protect the entire body and so we're you know as a result we have more and more patients with dementia because we can keep the heart and the cardiovascular system healthy these days much better than we used to but the brain still ages [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] you
