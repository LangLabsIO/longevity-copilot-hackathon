[Music] autophagy is if you don't know it's the cell's ability to digest proteins and recycle them the garbage or trash can of the cell so normally we do a good job of it but not perfect and that's why we think we accumulate these plaques in the brain among other tissues and if you fast for three days actually you turn on a very deep cleanse called chaperone-mediated autophagy so that's another reason to to go hungry and autophagy is very good and it does extend the lifespan of animals and probably helps us as well in terms of the epigenetic theory of aging we think that autophagy gets screwed up uh because the genes that are controlling autophagy come on at the wrong time and you get dysregulation of low genes and one of the reasons is that those mice that we we caused aging in they have all the hallmarks of aging they have mitochondrial dysfunction we think they have defective autophagy senescent cells and so that's why we think that this epigenetic theory is the the primary dam and that these others are tributaries [Music] foreign
