[Music] the three ways you often see it written n a d n a d plus and nadh and basically people turn a right NAD with and without the plus interchangeably does not really you know a great deal of difference there but on a molecular term there is a difference between NAD plus and nadh and NAD plus is basically what we would call an oxidized form of NAD and nadh is called the reduced form of NAD and basically this is a in chemical terms it's to do with the the function of how NAD works so basically NAD flips between these two different states very easily by losing or gaining an electrons and that's how it actually generates helps to generate energy in the mitochondria so in the body sometimes it'll be an ID plus and sometimes it'll be nadh but the one that's most implicated in longevity and aging is the NAD plus form one of the best ways is looking at fasting so NAD levels you know can naturally fluctuate according to you know what you're eating NAD can almost be measured is it like a mark is it sort of linked between energy stress and nads in the middle and then you've got the cells so the cell the nads going up or down depending on how much energy stress the cell has because if you think about it if you if that cell is in energy stress so you're faster and you've got no nutrients coming in the cell kind of needs to say right there's energy stress here we're not going to get a new supply of amino acids or whatever we need to build new things therefore the cell is going to have to be resolvable it's going to have to repair things it's going to have to recycle things and therefore let's put an ad up so it switches on all those things and we're not being wasteful however if you're eating burgers for breakfast lunch and dinner and you've got an abundance of energy coming in yeah NAD levels are dropping it's saying in the cell do you know what do what you want don't need to repair house got loads of energy coming in like our body's not in danger what's the point in trying to fix it so so that's one way that NAD can fluctuate with fasting the other thing is exercise so when I'm talking about this recycling pathway and it declining as you get older and the reason it declines is because the the key enzyme in that pathway specifically declines and this enzyme is called nampt and exercise has been shown to actually boost your nampt levels in your cells so just by doing some exercise you can actually improve the recycling capacity of your cells to use and recycle NAD so that's been quite well studied now as well [Music]
