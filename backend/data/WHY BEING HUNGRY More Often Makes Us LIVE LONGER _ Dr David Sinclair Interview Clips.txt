[Music] so what's interesting about the science of aging is that people over the centuries arguably that millennia have figured out why certain populations and individuals live longer than others and and it's just observation right it's it's obvious that if you eat mediterranean-like diets and you don't eat overeat uh carbohydrates in particular that if you become obese if you don't move these lead to poor health outcomes and shorter lifespans and we can do this to animals in the lab it's pretty easy you can shorten their lifespan by about 40 and the opposite is true as well if you take animals and i include dogs and rats um mice of course in my lab if you restrict how much they eat uh roughly twenty thirty percent i mean it doesn't matter how you do it as long as you do it you can skip a meal a day or you can just give them a little bit each meal that has remarkable longevity and health benefits so that they're not just living longer actually at the same age they are remarkably healthier compared to the mice that ate whatever they wanted to called ad libidum so this is not new and it's not even rocket science um even exercise we know that 10 minutes of losing your breath every day has health benefits but nobody's really come up with a good explanation as to why that happens it's so obvious we take it for granted but why does eating eating less make you healthier and that's where these breakthroughs have come in my field over the last 20 years have discovered three key areas in the cell three key genetic pathways that respond to diet and exercise and hunger and turn on the body's natural defenses against the deterioration process we call aging and then we've taken that just recently much further and achieved what exercise in a good healthy diet could could never alone do and that is reset the age of the body [Music] [Music] you
