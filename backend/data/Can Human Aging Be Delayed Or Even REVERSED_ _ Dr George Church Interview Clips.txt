[Music] but everything's moving faster now and one of the things that's moving faster is our ability to reverse aging so if we can reverse aging then yes you will definitely be around to see all sorts of things because there's no there's no particular law of physics that we know of that requires aging we know that there are there's a continuity of life that goes back three billion years so there's no particular reason why um humans or animals in general have to have to senesce and get old and and break because there's cotton some of the cells in the body keep on living in the in the next generation we have very active projects plural on on aging reversal not so much on longevity where you don't want to prolong the end of life which is unpleasant and expensive and where you become you know less productive member of society less engaged you want to what you want to do is reverse it back to a time where you were at your optimum uh performance you know a young person like 65 years old well it's been it's not only possible it's been done in animals now those animals may or may not be good models for human but it's it certainly is the time is ripe for testing things that either cause longevity in animals or aging reversal animals and then test to see if they can cause aging reversal in in larger animals and humans well there are many there are many things that have been shown to increase the animal lifespan by a factor of two to a factor of ten they're things that involve i mean not to get too technical but the mitochondria the the tips of chromosomes the telomeres the the growth factors and muscle related proteins like myostatin pathway so there's all these pathways that are pretty well understood and if you harness a little of each for gene therapy then you can try them separately in combinations gene therapy is particularly easy to go from an idea to a test of it you don't have to take a side route where you randomly screen through millions of pharmaceutical compounds well we have lots of demonstrations and animals both of longevity extreme extension of longevity and reversal in some cases uh many different ways of doing that and so we're collecting all of those that are known for small animals and we're applying them to large animals into humans the gene you know coming up the gene therapy trials is much easier but we're still just beginning on that it's it's looking very promising but it's too early to say so the projects that i find most compelling and exciting in terms of applications are transplantation of organs there's a gigantic need for that gene drives to eliminate malaria and then for developing nations and then aging reversal for industrialized nations where most of the morbidity and mortality is due to diseases of aging you want to get at the core of that and then once you have all those things which are drains on our economy if you can solve all those then you can reduce you have more money available for things like space where we really need to get off the planet to avoid super volcanoes and asteroids and that has a genetic component as well [Music] you
