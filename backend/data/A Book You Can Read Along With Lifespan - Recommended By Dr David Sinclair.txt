[Music] I said Alex I'm really encouraged by how lifespan the book has done there's a lot of people who have been encouraged by reading the book and change their Lifestyles after reading it and so it's it's education for sure I'm really excited that lifespan has been read by so many people now you know 99 of the world has not yet read it and they are still at the mercy of the advertisers and marketing campaigns that said I think there is a role for scientists like me to begin the education um and then those people talk to other people and you know you can see across the world that people now have heard of fasting they've heard of cold therapy you know Wim Hof is is you know I'm very grateful to him he's also saying the same things but it it's a slow education because first of all not a lot of people read books only a small percent listen to podcasts honestly um and most people just watch TV and advertising and so it's slow but we're getting there and I think that we're in this new age especially after the pandemic of people taking their health much more seriously and realizing that they can't just go to the doctor once a year and expect to say stay healthy the doctors are too busy they don't have the tools it really has to come from within it has to be you changing your life to have the impact that I'm talking about so Sergey young here we go he was kind enough to give me a copy of his book yesterday okay I've read this before he just gave me a nice signed copy kindly yesterday pin and I had breakfast with him yesterday and shared a lot of this information so my book is about the science and the health of Aging this is more biohacking technology where are we going a companion to my book and so I I recommend this as a companion uh to lifespan [Music]
