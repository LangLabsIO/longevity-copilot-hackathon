[Music] well i don't see the uh the fda changing in a hurry so that's not where the innovation is going to come from as much as they say they'd like to speed the process up it's still a few hundred million dollars per drug at a minimum because of all of the regulations which are of course in place for good reason there have been some terrible historical events where a drug has killed people we don't want that to ever happen again um but at the other end of the spectrum we have 100 000 people dying every day from age related diseases that i think could be tackled if we had uh better ways of of getting drugs on the market that were more efficient and by more efficient i mean less costly it's so expensive to make a drug um that's the problem and and sometimes people say well what dave why don't you just stick to your lab why do you have to start these companies well that would be great if i could get 500 million dollars in my lab and run a clinical trial but i just can um and and get a drug on the market so if i'm going to make drugs i have to go out of the academic circuit um but i think we we now live in an era where we are able to take our health into our own hands and see what works for us and what doesn't both as um individuals buying products that are that are legal and available online um or in shops of course that's nutraceutical area there are some cosmetics that are active as well and then when you get into pharmaceuticals or regulated molecules you can work with your doctor such as it's it's becoming more standard to ask your doctor for metformin before you have type 2 diabetes and those two models will will continue to play out but the biggest innovation is going to be at least until the fda declares aging and a true disease which hopefully will happen in the next five to ten years um where the innovation is going to come is that uh people can uh look at what works for them and so when the traditional medical establishment says um oh we have to wait till it's proven in a clinical trial i would push back and i would say nothing is proven in biology and until you take it we don't know what's going to happen and all drugs are unsafe in fact and while it may be safe in a thousand people there's going to be one it could be you that reacts badly and so it's all about individual personalized medicine at this point but to do that you need to measure things and be very careful about what you choose to put into your body and who's supervising you and my approach has been and i think this is the one that is becoming more popular is to only change one thing at a time and then and then take a reading and see what happens to your body did things get worse do they get better is your liver okay are your kidneys functioning okay is that product from that company okay and if it is keep taking that and try something else and that's why my regime that i have um you know it wasn't just made up yesterday it's taken over a decade to get to this point even with the particular brands that i take um you know it's it's not perfect but it is all we have right now we have to work within the law and and technology but i'm i'm not one of these people that says i'm going to wait up another 20 years till it's proven because first of all they're gonna be a lot of people who die tomorrow uh second of all i'm i'm probably gonna be uh you know fairly sick at that point my father will be dead for sure if we don't do something and it's it's like um you know people say oh i don't know what's going to happen if i take supplement x okay never mind the fact that it's already been taken by 100 000 people for the last five years that it's been clinical trials it's been in animals for years there are still some people that say i need you know proof um but let's let's face it if you if you wait for that proof it's going to be too late for most people and so i i think just choosing molecules and vendors are very high quality and seeing what happens you can escalate the dose carefully that's what's done in clinical trials i think that's the way to go um and that's that's far better than taking a handful of pills and never measuring anything you could really be doing yourself some harm but i would say uh that's important is first of all i'm not a physician i don't recommend anything but you do want to tell your physician that you've taken these molecules so that they can make sure that if anything bad happens they know what to do about it [Music] you
