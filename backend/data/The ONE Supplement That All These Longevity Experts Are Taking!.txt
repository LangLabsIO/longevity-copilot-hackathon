[Music] the fish oils those are very important for inflammation it turns out one of these molecules activates cert one and maybe that's why these are good for health and it's been shown to help in brain health this is this is shown in many different scientific studies Omega fatty acids PA and DHA which you can get in supplement form they're typically a squishy little capsule gel and so I take a gram or so of those substances also combined with some oleic acid which is an omega-9 these are the two are Omega-3s interestingly According To Grim age we did find that people who used Omega-3 supplements of fish oil they were actually aging more slowly and we thought this was a nice little incident oh that's interesting because I take fish oils me too yeah because what happened is I want to say six months ago um there was a publication really very large scale clinical trials looking at fish oil supplementation and they did not observe any benefits and I said oh my God I wasted all these years eating fish oil but then um we analyzed really in there we did see this Association that women who took fish oil supplements were aging more slowly according to grimage you know yeah and I'll just add a note to that study you mentioned the big vital D study which was a vitamin D and omega-3 did a huge study yes there was no effect on the primary outcome which was looking at all combined cardiovascular related events however when you specifically looked at Heart Like heart attack versus stroke there was a strong effect we know in the United States our average lifespan for females around 82 to 83 and for male I think it's something something like four to five years shorter than that in the United States in in Japan for example the average lifespan is about five years the life expectancy is about five years longer than in the United States and there was a really interesting paper from Bill Harris Dr Bill Harris he did this study looking at the What's called the omega-3 index which is a biomarker of both the Marine omega-3 fatty acids EPA and DHA in red blood cells and the reason he does it in red blood cells is because it's a long-term omega-3 biomarker versus I would say the majority of any type of Omega-3 test that you were going to do or ask your doctor your health care you know professional to to run for you it would be in flat it would be plasma phospholipids and and that's a very short it's a very it very much reflects your what I ate last night or what I ate two days ago kind of thing whereas red blood cells you're talking about the last 28 days and so um it's a much more accurate biomarker of someone's someone's omega-3 status so he found that in the United States the Omega people that had an omega-3 index of about four percent um had the lowest average lifespan versus people in the United States that haven't had the their omega-3 index about eight percent they had a five-year increase in life expectancy compared to the group with the low omega-3 index and what's interesting is that in Japan so in in the United States the average omega-3 index is about four percent five five percent so people don't eat enough they're not getting enough of the omega-3 fatty acids and particularly the ones from fish um and uh in Japan where they eat a lot of seafood they have an omega-3 index of a it's the average of around 10 10 and again their life expectancy is is you know five years higher than you know the United States so there are obviously factors in our lifestyle that affect um the way we age that affect disease risk and certainly uh Health span you know really is talking about extending the youthful part of your life keeping you disease free when you're older not necessarily making you live you know longer just improving the quality of your life because you're not going to get Parkinson's disease or Alzheimer's disease or have type 2 diabetes earlier in your life which really decreases the quality of your life I think the quali the quality of your life can there's just no doubt there's no doubt that that lifestyle plays a huge role in that fish oil I'm big on fish oil for all the health benefits um and I've been doing this for 30 plus years set of actions that we can take in order to limit inflammation and this has been shown in several quality peer-reviewed studies now to reduce inflammation and to relieve some and in some cases all of the symptoms of major depression one of those approaches is to increase our intake of so-called epas or essential fatty acids there's now a very long list of papers in quality peer-reviewed journals showing that when people ingest a certain level of EPA omega-3 fatty acids the relief from depressive symptoms matches the ssris that's incredible right that essential fatty acids could relieve symptoms of depression as well as some of the prescription antidepressants [Music]
