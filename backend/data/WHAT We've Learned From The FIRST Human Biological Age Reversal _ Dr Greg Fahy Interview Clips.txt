[Music] the objective of the trim trial was to take advantage of an observation that had been made many years before and was largely ignored and that was the observation that it was possible to regrow the thymus gland so to explain that the thymus is the master gland of the immune system it processes cells that are derived from the bone marrow into immune cells that are able to defend us against bacteria viruses and cancer and other things as well those are called t cells since they're educated in the thymus and you need those t cells to stay alive unfortunately the thymus begins to peter out it becomes more and more replaced by fat as we get older and so the process of producing t cells wanes and the t cells themselves are apparently very long-lived they can live many years and perhaps decades but eventually uh not producing them leads to a deficiency they don't last forever and they start to die out uh and so therefore between the ages of 60 and 80 you lose about 98 of your ability to recognize foreign invaders and that's the age range in which everybody dies just you know by and large that that's that's when age-related mortality really takes off and i don't think that's a coincidence uh we also know that the thymus is linked into other aging processes including aging processes that affect the brain the liver uh insulin signaling all kinds of things so the immune system has great significance beyond just immunity itself and the idea that you could actually regrow the thymus after it has withered and almost died and thereby restore immunity was a very appealing idea to me and since no one else seemed to be taking that up we wanted to try to do this in normal aging people there had been a couple of doctors who would in desperation treating hiv aids patients whose immune systems were being eaten by the aids virus the hiv virus they tried using growth hormone to restore immune system function they had a pretty good degree of success with that but that's a very small population and the thymus of those people is different from the thymus of you and me so it wasn't really clear what would happen in older people so we wanted to find out so we we created a protocol uh involving growth hormone which is the same same substance that was able to regrow the thymus in in the original observations of many many years ago and uh two other agents because growth hormone has side effects and i think one reason that growth hormone uh has not you know been a panacea against aging in the past is because it has these side effects particularly it has some obvious side effects like joints uh pain and things like that but the the real uh important one in my view is the silent one that people don't notice or pay much attention to and that is the so-called diabetogenic effect of growth roma which is a tendency for growth hormone to raise insulin levels so we wanted to we wanted to deliberately create a biological contradiction we wanted to have the benefits of growth hormone but but interfere with that second function of growth from raising insulin levels so we did that in two ways one by reproducing a natural biological contradiction that occurs in everybody as they're young which is mediated by the hormone dhea or dehydro epi indrosterone and the significance of this is that in youth we have very large amounts of growth roman we have very large amounts of dhea and we have very normal levels of insulin we are not diabetics when we're young so there has to be a reason for that what's different about an old person who takes growth hormone and gets diabetes essentially versus a young person who doesn't and i hypothesize that the reason that there's a difference is that the young person has dhea so we tried that i tried it on myself several times take growth hormone watch my d and my insulin level go up and then on the same uh dose of growth hormone i take the ag on top of that and watch my insulin level come right back down to normal so having satisfied myself that at least it worked on me we decided to try it in this initial clinical trial and uh in case that wasn't sufficient we also added metformin because metformin is a wonderful drug for increasing what is called insulin sensitivity the ability of insulin to do whatever insulin wants to do the beauty of that is that by i mean it's a little bit uh paradoxical but the beauty of that is by increasing the effectiveness of insulin insulin concentrations in the bloodstream actually go down because you don't need as much insulin so whatever insulin does it's bad you know it may be uh the uh the areas of the body that uh it's not very effective in uh that that are the source of the problem so if you increase insulin effectiveness you lower the concentration in the bloodstream everything is much better and one of the guidelines there is that calorie restriction has been known since 1935 to greatly extend lifespan of mammals and the thing that's really striking to me about calorie restriction is that in that situation both insulin and glucose are low at the same time which means that one of the central features of calorie restriction for life extension is to enhance insulin sensitivity in other words insulin effectiveness so that insulin concentrations can go down and so we're trying to mimic that as as well as we could with trim
