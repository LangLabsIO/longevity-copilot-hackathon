[Music] these molecules have certain colors and flavors that i can steerable towards and often it's you don't need to be a beagle to know the difference if you get resveratrol and it's not light gray fluffy um or white it's it's often brown or dark basically black throw that away that means either gone off or it was never purified you'll probably get diarrhea something worse um so look look for these products to be white or light gray um resveratrol will taste a bit like uh cement um and behave a lot like cement so that's why i mix it in factor just before we came on i was mixing some quercetin and some physique and uh normally do that in the morning i was busy uh and you have to mix that with yogurt um or with some olive oil because otherwise it's it's gonna be like concrete it doesn't get into the body so that's resveratrol um most brands of resveratrol actually have resveratrol in them so that's good news you don't have a lot of risk there i won't mention brands but i would say look for companies that make products that are what are called gmp uh good manufacturing processes and that means that there's not bits of metal and insects um so do that but also get greater than 98 or supplements that's a good guy um often there are these blend extracts of this and i like to avoid them they're not consistent and often the people who make the products don't know what's in them um and in case of nmn and those things should be white uh and crystalline if they start to go a little bit red uh in the case of nr it's gotten wet it's bad don't use that um and these products especially uh nr and to some extent animen you want to keep them in the fridge and if you want to store them for more than a few months put them in the freezer because they do upgrade over time and that's something that isn't known um nmn if you want to know if it's the real stuff it should taste a bit like sweet popcorn it's got a sugar on but the molecule of animen is a sugar which is a ribose and a phosphate and then vitamin b3 stuck on that and that you taste tasty sugar but you know that's basically the tip to go for a highly pure 98 plus bmp and and a company that not just started up last week there are a few of them out there that are that have been around for eight or more and uh trusted by doc as well [Music] you
