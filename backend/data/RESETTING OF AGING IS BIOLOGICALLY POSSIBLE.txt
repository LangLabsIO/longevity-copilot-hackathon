[Music] even the fact that I am a developmental biology and reproductive biology you know by uh by training I really believe that there is a lot about the the biology of development the biology of embryonic development and germ cells development that can be utilized for the purpose of actually combat aging although there are many Hallmarks of Aging that have been you know described I personally believe that the the epigenetic aspect of Aging is really kind of the fun the fundamental linchpin of the of the problem and and I'm not necessarily saying that you know the epigenetic uh changes are the cause or the consequence of Aging you know they could be both but fundamentally speaking you know if you take into account what happens in the cells you know sell autonomously but also non-cell autonomously these all these uh different phenomena or these different triggers at the end of the day affect the epigenome at the end of the day affect the way cells behave what genes they express what they don't express and that is again fundamentally driven and controlled by the Epi genome and we we know of course that's with age so if we go from younger to Old cells you know that epigenetic information dramatically changes at all levels okay what I really care about is that if it is true and it is true that the epigenetic information changes with age and that aging is fundamentally kind of the linchpin of a number of of these of diseases if we can tackle or if we can somehow reset the epigenetic information potentially we could actually really intervene at the roots of the aging process and with that we could potentially you know tackle a simultaneously all of these all of these indications okay so big picture but I think I think there is that's definitely reasons to believe that that this could put this potential is possible so how well let's go back quickly uh to and again I put my developmental biology a kind of you know lenses on and we know that the epigenetic information is is a is tunable it's programmable right why well we know this from the fact that during development this epigenetic information changes and it can be completely reset to almost uh kind of a stage zero or an age zero uh type of regenerative information uh it's not a crazy idea because actually if you think about the facts if you think about for example somatic cell nuclear transfer experiments you're pretty familiar with the you know the Dolly the sheep cumulina the mouse and so on and so forth that experiment basically shows that if you take a somatic nucleus from any differentiated cell of any age you take that nucleus and you put it in the cytoplasm of an egg uh the egg has all the information to reset that program back to an embryonic-like cell to the point that now you can make a cloned animal you know a full you know a fully living organism out of out of that process and guess what the lifespan of that individual of that clone animal is for the most part normal so that means that whatever epigenetic information meaning age related epigenetic information was accumulated in that original somatic cell that that information can be reset completely to zero to the point now that now the new organism has a normal lifespan and in principle you can you can keep doing this you know and in in some in some way think about you know immortality from uh again from a from a cellular and epigenetic standpoint now we also know that the same process uh you know in a way simplified but also you know similarly dramatically effective is the the process of reprogramming to ipscs that was that was pioneered by by Shinee yamanaka we know that we can take an old cell somatic fully differentiated and we can make an IPS so an embryonic like cell which is fully reprogrammed and which is used for by all means now if we take that cell and we we differentiated it for example in the same original cell type we get we get the original cell type but the cell this cell now is is Young by all needs so and this has been shown you know again in a variety of different different ways so the embryonic cells or the embryonic-like cells the ipscs and the progeny of those cells are useful by all means they have longer telomeres they have you know in enhanced mitochondrial functionality uh from the epigenetic standpoint they they are younger they can cope with DNA damage much much better as useful cells uh of course you know this approach is scalable you know in principle for the same reason why you can make ipscs from any cell type I think that you can make younger cell type from any cell type starting cell type as long as you know how you control that duration how you control that reprogramming window again in time and in duration foreign [Music]
