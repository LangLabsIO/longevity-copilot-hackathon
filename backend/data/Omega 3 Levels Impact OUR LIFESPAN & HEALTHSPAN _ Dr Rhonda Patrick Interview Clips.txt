[Music] there's obviously a genetic component to the way we age and there's a lifestyle component as well and you know i i've seen numbers anywhere between 40 to 60 percent as genetics and the other anywhere again you know you've got 50 50 to 60 is is lifestyle it's a scale you know in terms of the difference between maximum lifespan average lifespan and health span they're all interesting and maximum lifespan refers to the oldest age you can live to be and we know at least for humans they can live to be around 121 right that's that's i think the oldest recorded you know life lifespan for a human we know that you know in in the united state the the median or the average lifespan differs from country to country and that could be a combination of different genetic makeups you know different ethnicities there's different single nucleotide polymorphisms that are common within a certain ethnicity and there's also different lifestyles and cultures and you know many different factors within different you know regions of the world as well but we know in the united states our average lifespan for a female is around 82 to 83 and for a male i think it's something something like four to five years shorter than that um in the united states in in japan for example the average lifespan is about five years life expectancy is about five years longer than in the united states and there was a really interesting paper from bill harris dr bill harris who's one of the amazing he is just a a rock star in the omega-3 fatty acid field he's been studying it for decades and decades i mean he was like you know right after the dyersburg one of the famous papers that came out looking at the inuit population eskimo inuit and how they have like very little heart disease well he did this study looking at the what's called the omega-3 index which is a biomarker of both the marine omega-3 fatty acids epa and dha in red blood cells and the reason he does it in red blood cells is because it's a long-term omega-3 biomarker versus i would say the majority of any type of omega-3 test that you were going to do or ask your doctor your healthcare you know professional to to run for you it would be in pla it would be plasma phospholipids and that's a very short it's a very it very much reflects your what i ate last night or what i ate two days ago kind of thing whereas red blood cells you're talking about the last 28 days and so um it's a much more accurate biomarker of someone's someone's omega-3 status so the omega-3 index which dr harris co-founded along with um uh another scientist who can't remember his name unfortunately but he found that in the united states the omega people that had an omega-3 index of about four percent um had the lowest average lifespan versus people in the united states that haven't had the their omega-3 index about eight percent they had a five-year increase in life expectancy compared to the group with the low omega-3 index and what's interesting is that in japan so in the united states the average omega-3 index is about four percent five five percent so people don't eat enough they're not getting enough of the omega-3 fatty acids and particularly the ones from um and uh in japan where they eat a lot of seafood they have an omega-3 index of a it's the average of around 10 10 and again their life expectancy is is you know five years higher than you know in the united states so there are obviously factors in our lifestyle that affect um the way we age that affect disease risk and certainly uh health span which as dr fahey referred to you know really is talking about extending the youthful part of your life keeping you disease free when you're older not necessarily making you live you know longer just improving the quality of your life because you're not going to get parkinson's disease or alzheimer's disease or have type 2 diabetes earlier in your life which really decreases the quality of your life i think the qual the quality of your life can there's just no doubt there's no doubt that that lifestyle plays a huge role in that now whether or not you're gonna make yourself live you know to be a you know 100 years old based on your lifestyle factors i i'm not sure i think there's also a large genetic component as well in that and i think that that identifying biomarkers that can you know obviously empirically be measured are are key for for um looking at health ban and we're i think there's a variety of biomarkers that are now coming out that are being vetted as that and i honestly think the omega-3 index is one i do i think it's a it's a it's one of the the important ones um and it certainly reflects lifestyle uh diet and but there's others i mean there's inflammatory biomarkers and there's you can measure stress related ones as well and and certainly you know things that are stress related also affect inflammation and so there's a lot of crosstalk there as well but um there was a there was a study that came out of japan this was in 2015 where um they looked there was a variety of different age groups there was elderly people that were in their 80s there were the centenarians that were 100 there were the semi super centenarians that were about 105 and then there were super centenarians that are 110. and there was a panel of biomarkers measured we're talking like 12 to 18 and you know we're everything from hba1c which is a long-term marker of blood glucose levels you're measuring you know the standard lipid panels looking at ldl and just all the normal stuff liver enzymes things like that that you would do in just your your routine physical but they were also looking at a variety of inflammatory biomarkers they were looking at telomere length they're looking at immunosenescence which refers to your immune cells not being able to be functional although they're still there they're just not really functional so there's a variety of things that were looked at and the only thing that was actually consistent to for a person to advance to the next stage centenary and semi super sedentary and super centenarian was the suppression of inflammation and um so lower inflammatory biomarkers and they did a whole panel not just high sensitivity c-reactive protein which is like i would say a common one that's used in in clinical practice but it's not the only one i think there's a there's a panel of them if you're trying to be comprehensive that we're looked at so i thought that was very interesting because um you know you often think of like well telomere length and that wasn't actually important to advance to each each stage in terms of what can be done with diet and lifestyle to improve biomarkers to improve you know what we what we think might improve health span and i think that there's a lot of research that suggests that there are things that can be done and they can be measured and um so but we also have people that are you know following it and they're going and using companies like wellness fx which i don't have any affiliation with but like you can go and order a variety of blood plant panels and they have really good ones they have you know panels of inflammatory biomarkers and that you can measure that's not just high sensitivity c reactive protein you know so they have um you have people that are also really interested in preventative you know healthcare and in optimizing their their diet and their lifestyle based on science and so they're trying to learn themselves and and they also communicate with their physicians and work together and so i think there's a variety of different ways that people are trying to improve their lives and the lives of their family members and friends [Music] so [Music]
