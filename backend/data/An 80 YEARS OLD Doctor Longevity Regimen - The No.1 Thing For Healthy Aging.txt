[Music] foreign [Music] are a healthy diet regular exercise and for a healthy diet I was a vegetarian for a number of years I'm not a vegetarian anymore I'm just fanatical about eating healthy food and it's important for people to realize that the majority of your diet should be plant-based foods that contain dietary fibers and polyphenols to feed your gut microbiome people have to learn that when they eat you're not just feeding yourself you're feeding a hundred trillion guests you're feeding your gut microbiome and it's the dietary fibers and polyphenols and plant-based foods that are the food for your probiotic bacteria in terms of exercise I've got a study on my blog that I summarized on my blog a group of Italian scientists that studied a large number of elderly humans between the ages of of 96 and 100 and 405 and they looked at everything imaginable trying to figure out what's the number one thing for healthy aging and it turns out the number one thing for healthy aging is maintain your muscle mass so it's critical that people do some form of strength building exercise on a regular basis one of the new sections in my book I wrote a chapter on sarcopenia which is one of the real age-related diseases where you with aging you gradually lose your muscle mass and your strength and along with sarcopenia in that chapter I wrote about protein and weight training and strength training and rapamycin and how all of these things can actually slow down the process of sarcopenia a lot of uh people that regularly do strength training thought that this was not going to be a good idea for them that it would inhibit muscle growth but actually it's just the opposite we find out that when autophagy gets activated it's breaking down old damaged proteins and enzymes and and then when you start to reactivate mtor you are building new protein and new muscle mass so the process of autophagy really facilitates the growth of new muscle mass and so it's it's something that's actually very good for strength build and strength exercisers but in my second edition of my book I've really emphasized how critically important protein is especially for the elderly because as we age we are less able to recently to start synthesizing new protein and that can be compensated for by elderly people if they have more protein intake but most people as they age start eating less and eat and and ingest less protein so I really encourage people to read the section in my book and read how important it is to consume adequate amounts of quality protein after I do my strength training now I come home and I do a fruit smoothie with a protein powder supplement so I've got good protein available to my body to utilize after I've done the strength training um and so we know that strength training slows down autophagy and quality protein and then rapamycin also by inhibiting protein and allowing the body to break down some of the old structures so that it can be rebuilt during the mtor phase is really the process of rebuilding and renewing your body uh so after exercise and healthy diet of course you know about rapamycin and I do take a multivitamin I take extra vitamin C I take vitamin D and I try to keep my vitamin D levels up around 60 or 70 the normal medical range and most doctors in most Labs say that 30 or above is adequate I think that's malpractice I think people should try to get up around 60 to 70 nanograms per milliliter for vitamin D another one of my favorite anti-aging nutrients is Coenzyme Q10 and most people don't realize that most coenzyme Q10 products are close to worthless because coenzyme q10's melting point is 10 degrees higher than body temperature so the coenzyme Q10 and most product crystallizes and we cannot absorb clumps of coenzyme Q10 it has to be single molecules in solution in a company based in Europe Pharma Nord has a patented process for keeping their coenzyme Q10 in solution they've done multiple studies showing that the plasma levels for coenzyme Q10 from their product is 3 to 10 times higher than most other products on the market most of the big randomized clinical trials of coenzyme Q10 over the last 20 to 30 years have used Pharma Nords coenzyme Q10 as the product in their experiments and let's see uh what else do I want to recommend here I boost my glutathione levels regularly with one of the lactobacillus fermentum me3 products so I'm really I'm I just turned 80 a few months ago and so I'm really working at trying to get my aerobic fitness back and so I started doing spin classes at the Y and an hour spin classes really taken me to the wall but I'm determined to keep up with it because it's really important to try to maintain not only your muscle mass but also your aerobic fitness another supplement I want to just emphasize that's really critically important some of the omega-3 fish oils really very important for people to taking those on a daily basis also foreign [Music]
