[Music] Sam Altman is the CEO of openai the company behind the now famous chat GPT a breakthrough language AI he used 180 million dollars of his personal wealth to fund retro biosciences a company focused on human Rejuvenation which has a mission to increase healthy human lifespan by 10 years Altman Works closely with Joe Betts Lacroix Retro's CEO and co-founder bets Lacroix notes the company is all about creating something that billions of people can benefit from and that is generally affordable what are the Rejuvenation projects retro is working on now let's hear what their CEO has to say our mission uh which will not be lost on you is to add 10 years to healthy human lifespan we're not into creating things for billionaires or we don't want to discriminate against billionaires I'm just saying we don't want therapy is that are super expensive and awkward and difficult to implement and only a few people can afford to use them so that's another Criterion they have to be become like distributable Therapeutics so what are the commonalities between these things in the title of this talk between reprogramming and autophagy they're both so autonomous fundamentally um between autophagy and plasma um which is what I'm referring to by parabiosis um they're deeply engaged in the proteome at least the way we're working on it and the way working on it reprogramming and plasma we're working heavily in blood for our partial reprogramming efforts the tried answer to what's the commonality between all three of these phenomena is retro we are um like I say a startup going after aging writ large in Redwood City we have an initial funding of 180 million dollars which will last us minimally for 10 years of our work uh we got going immediately by converting 40 shipping containers in a giant Warehouse 23 000 square foot facility into lab spaces one of which is depicted in the background we are challenging ourselves to have a clinical trial in our partial reprogramming in humans by 2026 and a couple of different trials in our plasma program one next year for a discovery process and in 2025 for efficacy and in our autophagy program a clinical trial next year we will have approved Therapeutics in patients before the end of the decade thank you So to that I have the intimidating honor of following jean-mark like a global reprogramming expert our advisor Alejandro Ocampo figured out that well let's say you don't do this yamanaka reprogramming continuously and create a pile of protoplasm but instead you just do a little burst just a couple days and if you only go that far then amazing things happen he showed in mammals our Criterion that there are rejuvenated phenotypes a bunch of different rejuvenated phenotypes and they they they don't end up getting cancer or having other things that destroy their bodies so that's like what we can just reprogram cells and entire bodies and not kill animals and not probably not kill people that's incredible this is a whole new branch of biology um since then a bunch of labs all over the world have replicated this in various different tissues of various different phenomena phenotypes age-related characteristics that are reversed to a more youthful phenotype and muscle heart lung skin liver optic nerves and eyes even brains um like mice have seem to have better memory if you partially reprogram them and for the work that we're doing in partial reprogramming T cells having more youthful T cells turns out to be very useful because T cells the immune system itself is is uh such a fundamental part of our body like if you go any direction on average in a tissue within about three cells you'll hit an immune immune cell we have another program in autophagy autophagy is one of these things like I don't know like the nutraceutical vendors will try to convince you that oxygen all oxidation is bad in the body and you should take antioxidants and the antioxidants will solve all of your problems um but it turns out that it's actually a lot more complicated than that and oxidation in its various forms is critical for being alive even for T cells functioning um autophagy similarly is incredibly complex because it's basically every single broken thing or unused protein Etc has to get broken down and reused made into its component parts and reused inside the cell so there's a lot of different mechanisms for that but in just one of those we have found a Target that is related to a some aging phenotypes some important long-term aging issues and there happens to be a more acute disease that is also related to a failure of this kind of autophagy and plasma parabiosis side the history of that which he already described is that you do this kind of grizzly thing where you like sew together an old animal and a young animal and um he was talking about the old animal the younger animals getting older also the old animals get younger and that's pretty remarkable uh it's it's a little less clear how you intervene uh so how do we make that into satisfying one of those criteria for things that we want to work on at retro um but then later we were also inspired by some results from Convoy Lab at Berkeley where they were able to only take plasma out and showed some rejuvenated phenotypes um as Lou mentioned as well uh and then I just want to put a plug in here for vetting Gladys Chef you may be in the house incredible scientists one of our advisors in his group uh they showed that you can detach the parabayons as you call them um after a few months and then the the older ones continue to have rejuvenated phenotype uh afterward which is pretty exciting so we don't really want to have again these old billionaires having to pay the um plasma donors to come give them donations because that violates one of our tenants so we're not doing that um we're making medicines um and how do we make medicines out of this well so I I think that what Lou was saying is that pretty much all of the effect of the heterochronic para bias it seems to be either kind of the red side like the taking out of the bad things um we replicated the convoys experiments um we repeated them I'd say with a larger n um like number of animals in the groups and so on that are extremely carefully controlled and blinded conditions and not all of it replicated um so we don't feel as strongly that everything would be on the red side of like taking you know take the bad stuff out of the old animal um we think that there is a bunch of utility in the what is the good things that come from The Young animal as well [Music]
